can no prayers pierce thee?	0
alas that love ,  whose view is muffled still ,  should without eyes see pathways to his will !	0
is love a tender thing ?	0
it is a creature that i teach to fight, to wind, to stop, to run directly on, his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.	0
welcome ,  my lord .	0
strike as you did at caesar ,  because i know ,  when you hated him the worst ,  you loved him better than ever you loved cassius .	0
i am no villain .	0
where's publius ?	0
signior montano ,  your trusty and most valiant servitor ,  with his free duty recommends you thus ,  and prays you to believe him .	0
we don’t have any, sir.	0
out, and alas!	0
thou wast provokèd by thy bloody mind ,  that never dream’st on aught but butcheries .	0
hey !	0
that's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.	0
what ?	0
yes, and wisely too; because it would have angered any heart alive, to hear the men deny it.	0
when are you getting married ,  madam ?	0
o, that a man might know how today's business ends before it comes!	0
right glad i am he was not at this fray .	0
a truant disposition ,  good my lord .	0
scape being drunk for want of wine .	0
what says lord stanley ?	0
i may say  “ thrusting ”  it ,  for piercing steel and darts envenomèd shall be as welcome to the ears of brutus as tidings of this sight .	0
truly ,  my name is cinna .	0
i would have met you by sea and again by land .	0
in faith ,  my lord ,  not i .	0
cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!	0
hast thou the flower there ?	0
so i hope ,  i was not born to die on brutus' sword .	0
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top macbeth .	0
she made good view of me ,  indeed so much that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue ,  for she did speak in starts distractedly .	0
come ,  he has hidden himself among these trees ,  to have a sexual liaison with the moody night .	0
from now on ,  goodness in women ,  not superficial beauty ,  will win my heart .	0
a dog of the house of montague motivates me .	0
demand me nothing .	0
with drink ,  sir ?	0
how low we can fall ,  horatio .	0
he’ll go back to his egyptian dish .	0
and art thou living ,  stephano ?	0
and just try to remember a few rules of life .	0
i’ll apprehend him .	0
once again ,  what’s the news ?	0
my poor husband ,  my dear edward !	0
liberty !	0
how can you say these things ,  for shame ,  titania ,  give me a little more credit than that with hippolyta ,  knowing i know all about your love for theseus ?	0
dost thou like the plot, trinculo?	0
your reason ?	0
deny me this ,  and an eternal curse fall on you !	0
these times of woe afford no tune to woo .	0
you dance and prance and lisp; you call god’s creations by pet names ,  and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance .	0
though i wouldn’t wish to be better for my own sake ,  for your sake i wish i were twenty times more than myself—a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer—just so you might value me more ,  so my good qualities ,  beauty ,  possessions ,  and friends would be more than you could calculate .	0
my oberon!	0
don’t say that ,  lysander ,  don’t say that .	0
i cannot tell; i make it breed as fast as ewes and rams .	0
yes, caliban, her son.	0
how absolute the knave is!	0
she sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her ,  it’s true .	0
no ,  he’s in tartar limbo ,  worse than hell .	0
then if he dies ,  his death serves him .	0
madam ,  good night .	0
let her be round with him; and i'll be placed ,  so please you ,  in the ear of all their conference .	0
it may be so, for it is not mine own.	0
have with you .	0
quite chop-fallen?	0
they are then excused ,  my lord ,  when they see not what they do .	0
need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .	0
they’ll be here tomorrow or the next day .	0
to thee i do commend my watchful soul ,  ere i let fall the windows of mine eyes .	0
i will not be faced or bested .	0
heaven does truly know it .	0
doth not the day break here ?	0
how say you ,  lady ?	0
need you my help ?	0
how are you, jessica?	0
in the most high and palm tree - like state of rome ,  a little before the mightiest julius caesar was killed ,  the graves had no bodies ,  and the dead in sheets squeaked and gibbered in the roman streets ,  and stars with trains of fire and red morning dews ,  disasters in the sun .	0
please, peace.	0
there are no tricks in plain and simple trust ,  but hollow men ,  like horses very eager about something ,  make gallant show and promises of their spirit ,  but ,  when they are supposed to endure a spur that will make them bleed ,  they are humbled ,  and ,  like false ,  worthless horses disappear from the fight .	0
no .	0
he doesn’t miss much .	0
if hercules and lichas threw dice to decide who was the better man, the best throw may be turned by luck to come from the weaker hand: so alcides was beaten by his boy servant; and i might too, with blind fortune leading me, miss that treasure which a more unworthy man may get, and i’ll die from grieving.	0
so much i can’t express it.	0
if you have slain lysander in his sleep, being in blood over your shoes, plunge the knife deep into me and kill me too.	0
well then ,  now have you considered of my speeches ?	0
o woeful sympathy!	0
silence !	0
i pray thee ,  good horatio ,  wait upon him .	0
here's someone comes in his shirt ,  with light and weapons .	0
well, i conceive.	0
do not you chide; i have a thing for you.	0
but i can’t help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said ,   “ yes .  ”  i swear ,  she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster’s testicle .	0
it is not madness that i have utt'red .	0
death ,  that has sucked the honey of your breath ,  has had no power yet on your beauty .	0
should you do so ,  my lord ,  my speech should fall into such vile things that my thoughts are not aimed at .	0
get thee to a nunnery .	0
i’m not .	0
but ,  for your private satisfaction ,  because i love you ,  i’ll let you know .	0
away, go!	0
and when i get my reward ,  i’ll get out of here .	0
sir ,  i am vexed .	0
if not ,  to tell you i will die is true ,  but not for love ,  by god .	0
monday !	0
please go away ,  both of you .	0
oh ,  mischief has ruined our plans !	0
they sit conferring by the parlor fire .	0
the king of naples ,  being an enemy to me inveterate ,  hearkens my brother’s suit ,  which was that he ,  in lieu o' th' premises of homage and i know not how much tribute ,  should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom ,  and confer fair milan with all the honors on my brother .	0
who brought them?	0
i know thee well .	0
good hermia ,  please don’t act so bitter toward me .	0
for me ,  the gold of france did not seduce ,  although i did admit it as a motive the sooner to effect what i intended; but god be thankèd for prevention ,  which i in sufferance heartily will rejoice ,  beseeching god and you to pardon me .	0
can’t any prayers reach your heart ?	0
it is not, nor it cannot come to, good.	0
will you be married ,  motley ?	0
do not deny .	0
quiet !	0
i would not see ’t .	0
my liege ,  i am advisèd what i say ,  neither disturbed with the effect of wine ,  nor heady - rash ,  provoked with raging ire ,  albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .	0
thou runaway ,  thou coward ,  art thou fled ?	0
o ,  where is romeo ?	0
wilt thou tell a monstrous lie ,  being but half a fish and half a monster ?	0
yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?	0
fare you well, my dove!	0
great tyranny ,  lay your foundation solid ,  because goodness dare not challenge you !	0
how oddly it will sound that i must ask my child for forgiveness !	0
now leave me alone ,  as i said .	0
i see your own business needs you, and you take this opportunity to leave.	0
but let me go to my fortune and the chests .	0
your husband’s mad ,  isn’t he ?	0
i tell thee ,  constable ,  my mistress wears his own hair .	0
do you see, gentlemen?	0
you tell her ,  widow !	0
and what's he then that says i play the villain?	0
them brothers ,  friends ,  and countrymen .	0
i found it in my chamber; and he himself confess'd but even now that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire.	0
it shall to the barber's ,  with your beard .	0
oh well ,  god’s in charge ,  and some people have to go to heaven ,  while other people have to go to hell .	0
and these she interprets for warnings and portents and imminent evil, and on her knee, has begged me to stay home today.	0
let me see your eyes; look into my face.	0
the fee simple ?	0
home ,  you idle creatures ,  get you home .	0
and now i have the boy ,  i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes .	0
the brain may come up with laws to control society, but one hot temper jumps over a cold law; madness the youth is just such a jumper, skipping over the nets of good advice the cripple.	0
o, give me your hand, one written along with me in sour luck's book!	0
henceforward do your messages yourself .	0
edward’s unhappy sons do bid thee flourish .	0
welcome ,  good robin .	0
i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old ,  being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth .	0
is't not possible to understand in another tongue ?	0
tis said ,  man ,  and farewell .	0
you both know banquo was your enemy .	0
therefore be patient, take no note of him.	0
this world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change; for 'tis a question left us yet to prove, whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.	0
now you know why we’re in a hurry .	0
one more ,  and this the last: so sweet was ne'er so fatal .	0
your letters have transported me beyond this ignorant present, and i now feel the future in the instant.	0
oh ,  look ,  sir ,  look ,  sir !	0
send for the count .	0
you will take little delight in it ,  i can tell you ,  there is such odds in the man .	0
how green !	0
what's the matter?	0
see ,  it stalks away .	0
here’s what you’ll do .	0
i am thoroughly informed about the case .	0
sure we thank you .	0
yes ,  husband .	0
how are you ,  madam ?	0
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindred's vault; meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo.	0
for hamlet, and the trifling of his favours, hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood; a violet in the youth of primy nature, forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting; the perfume and suppliance of a minute; no more.	0
where’s the master ,  boatswain ?	0
oh ,  i followed something i’m ashamed to look at now !	0
aside .	0
pish to you ,  you mangy dog ,  you pointy - eared icelandic mutt .	0
i think you’re an ass .	0
i mean, sir, in delaying our entrance, we waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.	0
these growing feathers plucked from caesar’s wing will make him fly an ordinary pitch ,  who else would soar above the view of men and keep us all in servile fearfulness .	0
we are, my lord.	0
read it, mark antony.	0
most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope the lord's anointed temple and stole thence the life o’ the building.	0
i delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether .	0
there is a brief how many sports are ripe; make choice of which your highness will see first .	0
this song’s about my dead father .	0
therefore i took your hands ,  but was indeed sway'd from the point by looking down on caesar .	0
no ,  don’t .	0
only when they’re dead can i start to count my gains .	0
you sunburnt sicklemen of august weary ,  come hither from the furrow and be merry .	0
keep that promise, love.	0
against some part of poland .	0
amen to that, sweet powers!	0
come here, nurse.	0
let’s talk .	0
what’s the matter ,  husband ?	0
sir ,  i have done all this service since i left you .	0
look !	0
you’re  forgive me ,  signior gremio ,  but i’m anxious to get things moving .	0
hold !	0
come on .	0
here i have few attendants and subjects none .	0
so art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.	0
where is this sight?	0
and aroint thee ,  witch ,  aroint thee !	0
who's there, in the name of the devil?	0
that’s all there is to say .	0
your servants tend .	0
are you a god ,  an angel ,  or a devil ,  that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?	0
so .	0
oh ,  mighty caesar !	0
and this man is now become a god ,  and cassius is a wretched creature ,  and must bend his body if caesar carelessly but nod on him .	0
for three months; right ?	0
i will put my arms around you just as the woodbine twists around the sweet honeysuckle , — like the female ivy winds around the branches of the elm .	0
it’s my birthday .	0
fool !	0
you take your pennyworths now !	0
i plan to fall into the blackest despair .	0
and here will rest me .	0
no ,  that's not so .	0
officer ,  i’ll take the responsibility from you ,  and the blame too .	0
i humbly thank you ,  sir .	0
and then the boy ,  his clerk ,  that took some pains in writing ,  he begged mine .	0
it was merely a joke; i didn’t pay attention to it .	0
see ,  whether their basest metal be not moved; they vanish tongue - tied in their guiltiness .	0
hail!	0
make haste ,  make haste .	0
but i’ll marry you under different circumstances—with extravagant festivals ,  public festivities ,  and celebration .	0
turn up on your right hand at the next turning ,  but at the next turning of all on your left .	0
do not desire to see this letter .	0
my good my lord, may i a word with you.	0
well, i hope you see things are done well there, adieu!	0
why  “ puppet ”  ? —oh ,  i see where this is going .	0
so you had time as you were dying to look around ?	0
let me comply with it in these clothes, for fear that my welcome to the players, which i tell you must look good, should more appear like entertainment than your plays.	0
the portrait of a blinking idiot, presenting me a schedule!	0
hamlet comes back.	0
madam ,  i am not well .	0
oh ,  yes ,  i’m sorry ,  uncle . —if you’ll excuse me ,  your grace .	0
tomorrow ,  caesar ,  i’ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces i can raise for this war .	0
what is ’t o'clock ?	0
who am i ,  sir ?	0
it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge .	0
so sorrow's heaviness does heavier grow because my sleep has been interrupted .	0
or did the letters work on his blood, and newly create this fault?	0
we still know you are a holy man .	0
let those who would mar this fair land’s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth .	0
ay ,  very well ,  my lord .	0
earth's increase ,  plenty of feasting ,  barns and storage for game never empty; vines growing with clustering bunches of grapes; plants bowing with heavy loads of fruit ; spring come to you as long as possible ,  even to the very end of harvest !	0
let him let the matter slip ,  and i’ll give him my horse ,  gray capilet .	0
no ,  no ,  the bell .	0
it would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .	0
see, there she lies, flower as she was, deflowered by him.	0
demetrius loves her ,  and he loves not you .	0
we must not give in to hugs and kisses until midnight tomorrow.	0
but, alas, caesar must bleed for it!	0
all this is comforting news .	0
o ,  then ,  dear saint ,  let lips do what hands do .	0
but, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a great wager on your head.	0
pray, chuck, come hither.	0
hath any man seen him at the barber’s ?	0
they load caliban with the apparel] [they load caliban with the apparel] hey ,  mountain ,  hey !	0
tomorrow ,  my lord .	0
who started it this time?	0
i hear the strain of strutting chanticleer cry  “ cock - a - diddle - dow .  ”  where should this music be ?	0
he’s already done so .	0
i’ll give it back to you .	0
if she be black, and thereto have a wit, she'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.	0
what’s this ?	0
to adriana ?	0
for us and for our tragedy ,  here stooping to your clemency ,  we beg you listen patiently .	0
and having brought our treasure where we will ,  then take we down his load and turn him off ,  like to the empty ass ,  to shake his ears and graze in commons .	0
nor i ,  my lord .	0
truly ,  madam ,  he holds beelzebub at the staves' end as well as a man in his case may do .	0
your husband ,  being saddled with a shrew ,  projects his own suffering onto my husband .	0
to whom, my lord?	0
i will pour some in your other mouth.	0
hamlet, remember me.	0
tell him that ,  with his permission ,  fortinbras desires to carry out a promised march over his kingdom .	0
canst thou so daff me ?	0
we’re done for !	0
my servant !	0
i hope all will be well.	0
the cunning of her passion invites me in this churlish messenger .	0
good my lord ,  tell it .	0
we'll ha't tomorrow night.	0
my husband said that she was unfaithful !	0
we took this mattock and this spade from him as he was coming from this churchyard side.	0
what can i do for my lord ?	0
look for yourself—see the top of the cliff way up there ?	0
and let’s swear our determination.	0
thither he will come to know his destiny.	0
i wish i could answer this comfort with a similar one!	0
curse your eyes ,  they have looked me over and divided me: one half of me is yours ,  the other half is also yours ,  my own love ,  i would say; but if my love ,  then yours ,  and so everything yours .	0
sweet friends, i’m sorry i’m late; not i, but my affairs, have made you wait: when you are ready to do anything to get wives, i'll watch as long for you then.	0
no ,  i don’t know .	0
i’ll use it for fish bait .	0
belike this show imports the argument of the play.	0
see thou dissemble not .	0
no ,  honestly .	0
sola ,  sola !	0
i am for you .	0
i am sorry for her ,  as i have just cause ,  being her uncle and her guardian .	0
god make incision in thee; thou art raw .	0
o dear discretion ,  how his words are suited !	0
she says that you should come to her .	0
yes indeed .	0
three in egypt cannot make better note .	0
troth ,  no ,  no more than reason .	0
then how will we see their own natural tears ?	0
heaven truly knows that you are as false as hell .	0
moblèd queen ”  is good .	0
whose solid virtue could be neither grazed nor pierced by the shot of accident or dart of fate ?	0
sailors, my lord, they say, i didn’t see them.	0
give me your hand; take me to my host .	0
but i beseech your grace pardon me .	0
what beard were i best to play it in?	0
what do you think ?	0
i’ve seen both of you fence .	0
what is the matter ?	0
shall i entreat a word ?	0
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift .	0
he ate at my house ,  but that doesn’t make me nervous .	0
it fills me with fear and wonder.	0
to every roman citizen he gives ,  to every several man ,  seventy - five drachmas .	0
lunatics ,  lovers ,  and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .	0
alas ,  sir ,  it is worse for me than so ,  for i have bills for money by exchange from florence ,  and must here deliver them .	0
madam, how like you this play?	0
sirrah ,  fetch drier logs .	0
make your vaunting true ,  and it shall please me well .	0
music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .	0
and he and i will watch you wake up ,  and that very night romeo take you there ,  to mantua .	0
i have a wife whom ,  i protest ,  i love; i wish she were in heaven ,  so she could beg some power to change this currish jew .	0
i wouldn’t think much of it even if it were heavier .	0
pray god ,  sir ,  your wife send you not a worse .	0
no matter .	0
the brain may devise laws for the blood; but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple.	0
how did she get out?	0
what are you talking about!—how are you saying?	0
i can’t recall where i slept last night .	0
i mean, my head upon your lap?	0
i durst ,  my lord ,  to wager she is honest ,  lay down my soul at stake .	0
i beg you ,  when you see that act begin ,  even with the very criticism of your soul watch my uncle .	0
i beg you, take them back now.	0
i am not drunk now; i can stand well enough ,  and i speak well enough .	0
tempt him not so too far .	0
cobweb .	0
the  right .	0
pish!	0
isn’t my jacket, sir, as fresh as the first day i wore it?	0
your tale, sir, would cure deafness.	0
how are you, my very beautiful bianca?	0
amen to that ,  sweet powers !	0
and ,  moreover ,  god saw benedick when he was hid in the garden .	0
mistrust of my success hath done this deed .	0
good !	0
nothing at all; yet all that is i see.	0
i don’t value my life at the price of a pin ,  and as for my soul ,  what can it do to that ,  being a thing that is immortal as it is ?	0
look to her ,  moor ,  if thou hast eyes to see .	0
that it should come to this !	0
i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee ,  thou spend’st such high - day wit in praising him . — come ,  come ,  nerissa ,  for i long to see quick cupid’s post that comes so mannerly .	0
the reason that i gather he is mad ,  besides this present instance of his rage ,  is a mad tale he told today at dinner of his own doors being shut against his entrance .	0
ay ,  nurse; what of that ?	0
no, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.	0
the king rises.	0
cheer up, antonio!	0
gallop apace ,  you fiery - footed steeds ,  towards phoebus’ lodging !	0
will ’t please you taste of what is here ?	0
in what ,  my dear lord ?	0
good gertrude, put a guard over your son.	0
if not ,  what can you do about it ?	0
let him thank me ,  that holp to send him thither ,  for he was fitter for that place than earth .	0
and ,  dying so ,  death is to him advantage; or not dying ,  the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained .	0
throw physic to the dogs, i'll none of it.	0
remember; and call thy husband hither.	0
you say well .	0
what's he that was not born of woman?	0
is your little pearl in there ?	0
i beg you, leave.	0
hi, fair helena!	0
please find a way to give me some time alone with desdemona ,  if you think that’s all right .	0
well, sir.	0
i would not be the villain that thou think'st for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp and the rich east to boot.	0
will you be ready?	0
here .	0
o loving hate!	0
away ,  skinny man !	0
a crutch ,  a crutch !	0
he hath given his empire up to a whore; who now are levying the kings o’ th’ earth for war .	0
don pedro is here .	0
a good wench; give it to me .	0
tranio got you that time .	0
ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	0
no ,  truly ,  sir; not a penny .	0
what’s going on here ,  general ?	0
these vows are hermia's.	0
the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse; in half an hour she promis'd to return.	0
no ,  lepidus ,  let him speak .	0
and so do i too ,  lieutenant .	0
oh setebos ,  these are handsome spirits !	0
what have you done ?	0
a very pleasing night to honest men.	0
you know what i intend .	0
come on ,  then .	0
by my father’s death— your life has dishonored his death .	0
who calls ?	0
he is coming .	0
o strange!	0
do not ,  my lord .	0
to prison; till fit time of law and course of direct session, call thee to answer.	0
hell is murky !	0
husband ?	0
o lady ,  speak again !	0
we'll wait upon you.	0
ah, dear juliet, why art thou yet so fair?	0
nurse ,  will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry i’ll need to wear tomorrow ?	0
can’t you rest awhile?	0
what, and my old venetian friend, salerio?	0
come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly what thou think'st of him.	0
show yourself in the form of a sigh .	0
this dagger shall forbid it.	0
pray you, let cassio be received again.	0
where is my romeo?	0
this courtesy ,  forbid thee ,  shall the duke instantly know ,  and of that letter too .	0
come ,  come ,  you’re making fun of me .	0
that’s the necklace i gave you ,  sir .	0
how wilt thou do for a father?	0
i never did regret doing good, and i won’t now; because in companions that talk and waste the time together, whose souls bear an equal burden of love, there must be a sharing of things like proportion of limbs, manners, and spirit, which makes me think that this antonio, being the closest friend of my lord, must be like my lord.	0
dear mr .  fabian ,  do me another favor first .	0
go to your cabins and be quiet !	0
how silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night, like softest music to attending ears!	0
sir ,  fifteen days of march have gone by .	0
what ,  wouldst thou have me go and beg my food ,  or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road ?	0
i will ,  as surely as i am a gentleman .	0
but ,  my good lord ,  your graces' words shall serve as well as i had seen and heard him speak; and do not doubt ,  right noble princes both ,  but i’ll acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this case .	0
i hope heaven protects him from the weather ,  because i lost sight of him on the stormy sea .	0
how are you feeling now ?	0
they vanished strangely.	0
i know our country disposition well; in venice they do let heaven see the pranks they dare not show their husbands; their best conscience is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.	0
their hands and faces were all badged with blood .	0
why ,  do you know if any harm's intended towards him ?	0
my lord ,  i’ll say goodbye now .	0
think of it .	0
please treat my babies well .	0
if not ,  adieu .	0
you can refuse to make me your spouse ,  but i’ll be your servant whether you want me to or not .	0
this is the door .	0
one woe doth tread upon another's heel, so fast they follow.	0
and should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?	0
if you do meet horatio and marcellus ,  the rivals of my watch ,  bid them make haste .	0
not me .	0
where's the thane of cawdor?	0
i know not if't be true; but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety .	0
if everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow ,  then sorrow would be highly prized .	0
that ,  being mad herself ,  she’s madly mated .	0
he is the brooch indeed and gem of all the nation.	0

here .	0
then i'll be brief .	0
but now i'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.	0
i commend my duty to your lordship.	0
let it all go.	0
seek ,  seek for him ,  lest his ungoverned rage dissolve the life that wants the means to lead it .	0
it wouldn’t surprise me ,  my lord .	0
and on the answer ,  he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .	0
everything you told me i already knew .	0
do so: to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me .	0
i do spy a kind of hope ,  which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent .	0
now i change my mind, and partly credit things that do presage.	0
very bad luck!	0
i think there’s never a man in christendom can lesser hide his love or hate than he ,  for by his face straight shall you know his heart .	0

o sweet mistress ,  speak !	0
i wish i had met my dearest enemy in heaven before i had ever seen that day, horatio!	0
my good friends ,  hark !	0
a clever speech is wasted on a stupid ear.	0
did we ,  my lord ?	0
they say he parted well and paid his score .	0
oh ,  thereby hangs a tail .	0
do you not hear me speak ?	0
this concurs directly with the letter .	0
is there not charms by which the property of youth and maidhood may be abused ?	0

come ,  i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .	0
nay, but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love over the nasty sty!	0
the ones you’ve sent our lunatic king to .	0
my first lie ever was these things i said about myself.	0
and yet my sky shall not want .	0
you have seen nothing ,  then ?	0
good my lord, will you see the players well bestow'd?	0
a faithful shepherd worships you .	0

i have heard your grace has taken great pains to modify his stubborn course; but since he stands solid, and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envy's reach, i confront his fury with my patience, and i am ready to suffer the very tyranny and rage of his with a quiet spirit.	0
now go thy way .	0
my lord ,  i don’t know ,  but i truly fear it .	0
malcolm!	0
which is the lady i must seize upon ?	0
no more moving ?	0
cuckold me!	0
what ,  isn’t my mother coming ?	0
most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment.	0
i will look on it .	0
tell me the truth .	0
they do offend our sight .	0
trust to't.	0
and most chirurgeonly .	0
i have heard it over ,  and it is nothing ,  nothing in the world; unless you can find sport in their intents ,  extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain ,  to do you service .	0
i’m not cinna the conspirator .	0
i do beseech you that are of suppler joints ,  follow them swiftly ,  and hinder them from this ecstasy may now provoke them to .	0
i might do something i’ll be sorry for .	0
i’m not proud that you have ,  but i’m thankful that you have .	0
you take that .	0
take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.	0
for the dauphin ,  i stand here for him .	0
summertime in verona has no flower as fine as him .	0
it is not good and it cannot come to good.	0
spoken like a gentleman .	0
anon comes one with light to ope the tomb; and by-and-by my master drew on him; and then i ran away to call the watch.	0
she can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .	0
tis meet i should be used so ,  very meet .	0
no place indeed should murder sanctuarize; revenge should have no bounds.	0
and i his clerk; therefore be well advis'd how you do leave me to mine own protection.	0
but what is the sport ,  monsieur ,  that the ladies have lost ?	0
pray you lead on .	0
return to the gracious duke ,  good catesby .	0
i charge you ,  get you home .	0
back then ,  i called you  “ a poor ,  imitation queen ,  ”  a badly reproduced copy of what i was ,  a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow ,  a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell ,  a mother only teased with two beautiful children ,  who would soon die .	0
where ,  good miss mary ?	0
ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours ,  both you syracusians and we ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns .	0
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit ,  which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite .	0
certainly ,  sir ,  i can .	0
once more remove ,  good friends .	0
farewell ,  therefore ,  hero .	0
i will not.	0
i'll see it is done .	0
god protect me from these two !	0
the general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with desdemona . —i can’t blame him .	0
with nought but truth.	0
my master’s decision .	0
thou hast hit it .	0
why are you yelling at me so angrily ?	0
ha !	0
may i never to this good purpose ,  that so fairly shows ,  dream of impediment !	0
there on the ground ,  made drunk with his own tears .	0
i will move them to storms of tears; i will rouse their pity in some measure.	0
yes ,  he is dead .	0
i beg you, continue.	0
sir ,  is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly ?	0
madam ,  i will .	0
i'll about ,  and drive away the vulgar from the streets; so do you too ,  where you perceive them thick .	0
if echo were as fast ,  he would be worth a dozen like belman .	0
there’s protection in the theft that steals itself when there's no mercy left .	0
let’s say i didn’t kill them .	0
caesar ,  thy thoughts touch their effects in this .	0
my poverty agrees to take it, but not my will.	0
but the man who carried my letter ,  friar john ,  was delayed by accident ,  and last night returned my letter to me .	0
put the goblets of wine on that table .	0
but, o grief, where hast thou led me?	0
well, you shall see; your eyes shall be your judge, the difference of old shylock and bassanio:— what, jessica!—you won’t eat like a glutton, as you have done with me;—what, jessica!— and sleep and snore, and tear clothes apart— why, jessica, i say!	0
she's not fourteen.	0
who are you ?	0
as soon as the deed is done ,  you will be in my favor and i will promote you .	0
i dreamed the souls of the people richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory .	0
buy food and put on some weight.	0
and doubt not ,  sir ,  but she will well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you .	0
and he fixed his eyes on you ?	0
please don’t say no .	0
why ,  the night gone by .	0
what can’t it do?	0
god and our innocence defend and guard us !	0
lechery ,  by this hand; an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts .	0
how can we find out more?	0
no more but e’en a woman ,  and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares .	0
you mock an ancient tradition ,  born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died ,  and then have the gall not to stand by your words .	0
bless you ,  fair lady !	0
what shall i do ?	0
yet, i beseech you, if you think fit, or that it may be done, give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone.	0
good mercutio !	0
good ,  i’ll expect you .	0
i neither know it nor can learn of him .	0
give us the swords ,  come on .	0
for every minute is expectancy of more arrivance .	0
the king loves you very much .	0
come ,  mistress ,  you must tell us another tale .	0
i also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in genoa one night .	0
wake up!—" such instigations have often been dropped where i have picked them up.	0
it’s dangerous out there .	0
in the meantime, i wrote to romeo that he should come home, this bad night, to help to take her from her borrowed grave, at the time that the potion would wear off.	0
it is the lady that pyramus must love .	0
this man is pyramus ,  if you want to know; this beauteous lady is certainly thisbe .	0
thou hast mistaken quite, and laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight.	0
that’s good ,  if he’ll really do it .	0
how are you doing ,  charles ?	0
a fig!	0
if he wakes up before we kill him ,  he’ll never stop punishing us .	0
there’s only one body here .	0
where are you all off to ?	0
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds.	0
do you see this, o god?	0
come ,  go with me .	0
what?	0
but that’s just a fairy tale .	0
or wilt thou hunt ?	0
yea ,  is the worst well ?	0
let’s go in; and ask us all your questions, and we’ll answer everything truthfully.	0
your lady mother is coming to your bedroom.	0
edmund ,  farewell .	0
tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on ,  and for a sovereign’s sovereign to ride on ,  and for the world ,  familiar to us and unknown ,  to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him .	0
thank you .	0
our captains, macbeth and banquo, were not upset by this?	0
i am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.	0
alas ,  gentlemen— help ,  ho ! — lieutenant—sir ,  montano— help ,  masters ! —here’s a goodly watch indeed !	0
peace ,  smulkin .	0
we’ll have thee ,  as our rarer monsters are ,  painted on a pole ,  and underwrit ,   “ here may you see the tyrant .  ”       i will not yield ,  to kiss the ground before young malcolm’s feet ,  and to be baited with the rabble’s curse .	0
what an awful day !	0
troth ,  i think your other rebato were better .	0
or if you follow me ,  you’d better understand that i’ll do something bad to you in the forest .	0
be brave and do well !	0
fair ladies, you drop manna in the way of starved people.	0
i doubt not of your wisdom .	0
if we only find the tyrant's forces tonight, let us be beaten if we cannot fight.	0
do i speak to you kindly ?	0
the king his master needs must take it ill ,  that he ,  so slightly valued in his messenger ,  should have him thus restrained .	0
greetings ,  dearest caesar !	0
my best way is to creep under his gaberdine .	0
and for three months .	0
so, go; these griefs and losses have so upset me that i shall hardly have a pound of flesh tomorrow give to my bloody creditor.	0
how now ,  my metal of india ?	0
kill men i' the dark!	0
now god in heaven bless you !	0
at once, good night: stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once.	0
gone ?	0
if he but blench ,  i know my course .	0
lady strachy married her wardrobe manager .	0
what ,  not to pray ?	0
speak!	0
thou speak’st with all thy wit; and yet ,  i' faith ,  with wit enough for thee .	0
fast bind ,  fast find .	0
you killed this king ,  didn’t you ?	0
within a month ,  ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears had left the flushing in her galled eyes ,  she married .	0
o hamlet ,  what a falling off was there !	0
music ,  and a song music ,  and a song hark !	0
so rare a wondered father and a wife makes this place paradise .	0
brutus ,  my lord !	0
you shall see it will fall right just as i told you . —she comes from over there .	0
look, he meditates.	0
thy lover ,       artemidorus ”  here will i stand till caesar pass along ,  and as a suitor will i give him this .	0
do you not see that i am out of breath?	0
and what make you from wittenberg, horatio?— marcellus?	0
how is it with you ,  my lord ?	0
remember first to possess his books ,  for without them he's but a sot ,  as i am ,  nor hath not one spirit to command—they all do hate him as rootedly as i .	0
knock ,  sir ?	0
very good !	0
he hath the jewel of my life in hold ,  his youngest daughter ,  beautiful bianca ,  and her withholds from me and other more ,  suitors to her and rivals in my love ,  supposing it a thing impossible ,  for those defects i have before rehearsed ,  that ever katherina will be wooed .	0
until then ,  think about the well - being of rome .	0
their shadows seem a canopy most fatal ,  under which our army lies ,  ready to give up the ghost .	0
marry ,  sir ,  be better employed ,  and be naught awhile .	0
the government of a king dies with him ,  but draws what's near it with it ,  like a gulf .	0
three words ,  dear romeo ,  and good night indeed .	0
did you know him ?	0
if the prince be too important ,  tell him there is measure in everything ,  and so dance out the answer .	0
right well ,  dear madam .	0
guilt is so full of artless jealousy ,  that it spills itself in fearing to be spilled .	0
hold on a moment ,  and listen to my advice .	0
o father abram, what these christians are, whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect the thoughts of others!	0
i’ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her ,  but i won’t use one on her .	0
they’re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother .	0
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .	0
but please tell me ,  can you read anything you see ?	0
or have we eaten on the insane root that takes the reason prisoner ?	0
this man is pyramus, if you would know; this beauteous lady thisbe is certain.	0
why of thy thought ,  iago ?	0
ay ,  my good lord .	0
your mother .	0
i have news—old news such as you never heard before !	0
but here’s a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart ,  and that i beat him and charged him with a thousand marks in gold ,  and that i did deny my wife and house . — thou drunkard ,  thou ,  what didst thou mean by this ?	0
have i in conquest stretched mine arm so far to be afraid to tell graybeards the truth ?	0
are you going riding you this afternoon?	0
let’s not leave him out .	0
he is slain .	0
for brutus' sake ,  i’m grateful to you .	0
it is a villain ,  sir ,  that i don’t like to look at .	0
when you durst do it, then you were a man; and, to be more than what you were, you would be so much more the man.	0
three civil brawls, started by a meaningless comment, by you, old capulet, and you, montague have three times disturbed the quiet of our streets and made verona’s senior citizens take out sober mementos of war and fighting, to use them again as weapons, in their old hands, rusted from not being used, as hate has rusted your families.	0
give him a halter: i am famished in his service; you may tell every finger i have with my ribs.	0
i will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for ,  to speak to you like an honest man ,  i am most dreadfully attended .	0
what do you mean by being so stupidly fond like this on such goods ?	0
you have done that you should be sorry for.	0
what do you have to say for yourself ?	0
what !	0
when i was with him i have heard him swear to tubal and to chus ,  his countrymen ,  that he would rather have antonio’s flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he did owe him .	0
upon his royal face there is no note how dread an army hath enrounded him ,  nor doth he dedicate one jot of color unto the weary and all - watchèd night ,  but freshly looks and overbears attaint with cheerful semblance and sweet majesty ,  that every wretch ,  pining and pale before ,  beholding him ,  plucks comfort from his looks .	0
good and noble young man ,  don’t mess with someone who’s desperate .	0
have you forgotten i’m your mother ?	0
you have guessed exactly what i feared .	0
and here’s another poem ,  which i stole from my cousin’s pocket—in her handwriting and all about her adoration for benedick .	0
what means your lordship ?	0
what wife ?	0
i have .	0
what do you want ?	0
i do not know dat .	0
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?	0
if you aren’t weeping ,  it’s a good sign that i’ll soon have a new father .	0
good ensign, you are welcome.	0
did i not meet thy friends?	0
we will have more of this tomorrow .	0
playing the lord like that, not only with what my money yielded, but also whatever else my power might get him,—like one who having lied so often by telling it enough, made his memory such a sinner that it gave truth to his own lie,—he believed he was indeed the duke, making substitution for me, and wearing the outward show of royalty, with all rights and privileges.—here his ambition growing— are you listening?	0
why ,  what art thou ?	0
and false .	0
but you heard him swear up and down that he was .	0
i tell thee ,  kate ,  ’twas burnt and dried away .	0
groan ?  !	0
you pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?	0
i don’t blame you for praising caesar so; but what agreement do mean you to have with us ?	0
o, tell me!	0
if you can remember it ,  begin at this line ,  let me see ,  let me see .	0
well ,  it’s not for me to say .	0
i am their mother .	0
up and down, up and down; i will lead them up and down.	0
ay ,  my good lord .	0
our son shall win.	0
i do remember a pharmacist, and lives near here, who i noticed was dressed in in tattered weeds, with overwhelming eyebrows, choosing the simple life.	0
have you stolen it from her ?	0
he shall spurn fate ,  scorn death ,  and bear his hopes 'bove wisdom ,  grace ,  and fear .	0
i beseech you ,  follow straight .	0
it is well done ,  and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .	0
this tune goes manly .	0
beautiful portia's picture!	0
you are very sensible ,  and yet you miss my sense: i mean ,  hortensio is afeard of you .	0
not i; unless the breath of heartsick groans, like a mist wraps me up and hides me from the search of eyes.	0
iras ,  i won’t see you again for a long time .	0
do you have anything else to tell me ?	0
o hateful day !	0
send your man away .	0
a piece of him .	0
your bedchamber .	0
i prithee ,  do so .	0
what’s the news !	0
remember to see me today .	0
then make a ring about the corpse of caesar ,  and let me show you him that made the will .	0
leave you your power to draw ,  and i shall have no power to follow you .	0
he's gone.	0
no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous .	0
if you'll sit down i'll bear your logs the while .	0
any news from genoa ?	0
come to what is important in ’t .	0
he’s walking over there ,  sir .	0
because my name is george .	0
o my dear cassio, my sweet cassio!	0
discuss unto me: art thou officer or art thou base ,  common ,  and popular ?	0
fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you !	0
why came not the slave back to me when i called him .	0
ay ,  there it is .	0
i must to england; you know that ?	0
heaven does truly know it.	0
i pray you ,  know me when we meet again .	0
but since, you from the polack wars, and you from england, are here arrived, and so jump on this bloody question, give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view, and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about.	0
o heavenly powers, restore him!	0
i wonder if the lion is going to speak .	0
no offense taken .	0
for the sake of our old friendship ,  i ask you ,  hold my sword handle while i run on it .	0
i'll follow you; i'll lead you in a circle, through bog, through bush, through more bushes, through brier; sometimes i’ll be a horse, sometimes a hound dog, a hog, a headless bear, sometimes a fire; and neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn, like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.	0
please make him change his mind .	0
only why couldn’t i say ,   " amen "  ?	0
and when i don’t love you, chaos comes back.	0
enough ,  captain .	0
a particle of dust will turn the balance, which pyramus, which thisbe, is the better.	0
moody ?	0
if thou say so ,  withdraw and prove it too .	0
why ,  e'en so !	0
this island contains everything beneficial to life .	0
some comfort ,  nurse .	0
how chances it they travel ?	0
listen to me ,  beatrice— talking with a man outside her bedroom window !	0
now take them up ,  ”  quoth he ,   “ if any list .  ”    trembled and shook ,  for why he stamped and swore as if the vicar meant to cozen him .	0
since i have your good leave to go away, i will make haste: but, till i come again, no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay, nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.	0
speak low if you speak love .	0
o ,  where ?	0
what’s his offense ?	0
that's not amiss; but yet keep time in all.	0
don’t refuse it .	0
good faith ,  how foolish are our minds !	0
there's a poor piece of gold for thee .	0
come ,  come ,  let’s remember why we’re here .	0
no ,  that's true; that's very true .	0
what?	0
bless you, fair dame!	0
good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!	0
what, man!	0
i have lost the immortal part of myself, and what remains is bestial.	0
so, fare you well at once, for brutus' tongue hath almost ended his life's history.	0
fare you well ,  sir .	0
lo ,  where it comes again .	0
nay ,  hear him .	0
and mine, two hundred.	0
make we our march towards birnam .	0
he's dead ,  he's dead ,  he's dead !	0
these sentences ,  to sweetness or to bitterness ,  being strong on both sides ,  are equal .	0
alas, poor yorick!	0
who’s there ?	0
it makes me angry.	0
my liege ,  they are not yet come back .	0
i assure you .	0
give him the goblet .	0
my love forgives him so, that even his stubbornness, his checks, his frowns, i beg you, unpin my hair, have grace and favor in them.	0
it has the mark of	0
this disturbed sky isn’t one to walk in .	0
is all the counsel that we two have shared, the sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent, when we have chid the hasty-footed time for parting us,—o, is all forgot?	0
noble friends ,  let’s kill him boldly but not with anger .	0
they thought they would do some naughty charm on this man and maiden ,  who have vowed that they will not sleep together until the god of marriage's torch is lit ,  but they thought so in vain .	0
claribel .	0
o young and noble cato ,  art thou down ?	0
to bear all smooth and even ,  this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause .	0
things base and vile, holding no quantity, love can transpose to form and dignity.	0
who called for you ?	0
young fry of treachery!	0
wherefore?	0
oh ,  that a man might know the end of this day’s business ere it come !	0
you know my mind .	0
well then ,  here’s more money for you .	0
take away the fool ,  gentlemen .	0
perchance 'twill walk again .	0
doesn’t the sun shine palely down on them ,  as though in contempt ,  killing their fruit with frowns ?	0
rude am i in my speech, and little blest with the soft phrase of peace; for since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, till now some nine moons wasted, they have used their dearest action in the tented field, and little of this great world can i speak, more than pertains to feats of broil and battle; and therefore little shall i grace my cause in speaking for myself.	0
mine and my father’s death come not upon thee ,  nor thine on me .	0
you say you don’t know what the lady thinks about this .	0
thou art like one of these fellows that ,  when he enters the confines of a tavern ,  claps me his sword upon the table and says ‘god send me no need of thee ! ’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer ,  when indeed there is no need .	0
i go .	0
i tell thee ,  litio ,  this is wonderful !	0
lord hastings ,  you and he are close .	0
com’st thou again for ransom ?	0
give him a noose to hang himself .	0
will he tell us what this show meant?	0
fie !	0
i would have all well betwixt you .	0
remember me.’ i have sworn't.	0
full half an hour .	0
these many men then shall die; their names are checked on the list.	0
ay ,  that's a colt ,  indeed ,  for he doth nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself: i am much afraid my lady his mother played false with a smith .	0
look ,  here comes helena .	0
my fortune—like that of many of us tonight—is to go drunk to bed .	0
nor i, my lord.	0
cassio, i love you; but never more be an officer of mine.	0
i believe you believe what you say now ,  but what we determine to ,  often we don’t .	0
o ,  my fair cousin ,  i must not say so .	0
are you telling me this to make interest good ?	0
rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me .	0
humbly i thank your grace .	0
from hence to inverness, and bind us further to you.	0
and i ,  my royal sovereign .	0
where are these enemies ?	0
to whom ?	0
liberty!	0
i am so much a fool, should i stay longer, it would be my disgrace and your discomfort.	0
it was a color he never did like .	0
her eye discourses .	0
is not this something more than fantasy ?	0
when saw you my father last ?	0
what, not one hit?	0
scant not my cups ,  and make as much of me as when mine empire was your fellow too ,  and suffered my command .	0
since the torch is out ,  lie down and stray no farther .	0
cassius ,  what night is this !	0
poor birds they are not set for .	0
men should be what they seem; or those that are not, i wish wouldn’t seem so!	0
the whole world could look at you ,  and no one would be as blind as he is ,  thinking you’re beautiful .	0
thanks for that.	0
leave me quickly .	0
peace!	0
i’ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .	0
the head is not more native to the heart ,  the hand more instrumental to the mouth ,  than is the throne of denmark to thy father .	0
better once than never ,  for never too late .	0
kill men i' the dark !	0
a man is master of his liberty; time is their master ,  and when they see time they’ll go or come .	0
sir ,  this report of his did hamlet so envenom with his envy that he could nothing do but wish and beg your sudden coming o'er to play with you .	0
oh ,  villain that i am !	0
i wouldn’t marry her ,  even if she were as blessed as paradise .	0
why i should fear i know not ,  since guiltiness i know not; but yet i feel i fear .	0
it is some misfortune; the cry is very sorrowful .	0
so did i .	0
come ,  lieutenant ,  i have a stoup of wine ,  and here without are a brace of cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black othello .	0
and is't not to be damn'd to let this canker of our nature come in further evil?	0
five summers have i spent in farthest greece ,  roaming clean through the bounds of asia ,  and ,  coasting homeward ,  came to ephesus ,  hopeless to find ,  yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbors men .	0
ay, do you fear it?	0
look here upon this picture, and on this, the counterfeit presentment of two brothers.	0
which is he that killed the deer ?	0
no epilogue ,  i pray you; for your play needs no excuse .	0
each new morning, new widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows strike heaven on the face so that it echoes as if it felt scotland’s pain, and yelled out like a sigh of sorrow.	0
in spain ,  caesar had a fever ,  and it made him shake .	0
nay ,  if you strive— but half an hour !	0
i know his soul is in heaven ,  fool .	0
but on!	0
well ,  we’ll speak more soon .	0
i pray you ,  let it stand .	0
say something !	0
but why should honor outlive honesty ?	0
read it ,  great caesar .	0
i heard him groan.	0
what’s wrong ,  general !	0
who calls on hamlet?	0
if the prophecy is true ,  i have defiled my soul for banquo's sons; i have murdered the gracious duncan for them ,  put doubts and bitter feelings into my mind only for them ,  and i have given my soul to the common enemy of man ,  just to make them kings ,  the sons of banquo kings !	0
macbeth !	0
mine ache to think about it.	0
you shall not go, my lord.	0
but swords i smile at ,  weapons laugh to scorn ,  brandished by man that’s of a woman born .	0
all the infections that the sun sucks up from bogs, fens, flats, on prosper fall, and make him by inch-meal disease!	0
you gentle romans , — peace ,  oh !	0
you’re my true and honorable wife ,  as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart .	0
i might ask you for your commission ,  but i do take thee ,  orlando ,  for my husband .	0
i cannot tell.	0
god defend me from these two !	0
when i spoke that ,  i was ill - tempered too .	0
beautifully ,  sir ,  beautifully !	0
thus then in brief: the valiant paris seeks you for his love .	0
i know you are not ignorant— i would you did ,  sir .	0
who’s thisbe ?	0
they’re entirely welcome .	0
no ,  if your wits run the wild - goose chase ,  i’m done ,  because you have more of the wild - goose in one of your wits than ,  i am sure ,  i have in my whole five .	0
but i won’t leave this spot ,  no matter what they do .	0
i pray you, bring me on the way a little; and say if i shall see you soon at night.	0
for your life ,  you wouldn’t have dared .	0
sweets to the sweet .	0
may they relieve a sick old man’s suffering .	0
save me and hover over me with your wings ,  you heavenly guards !	0
he accuses me of withholding his share of sextus pompeius’ possessions ,  which we seized in sicily .	0
titania, call for music, and strike the senses of all these five so that they seem more dead than sleeping.	0
know i these men that come along with you ?	0
he is well paid that is well satisfied; and i am satisfied in delivering you ,  and therefore ,  i consider myself well paid: my mind never wanted anything else in payment .	0
all men’s faces are true ,  whatsome’er their hands are .	0
there never was so rich a gem set in something worse than gold.	0
the hearts of old gave hands; but our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	0
mine and my father's death come not upon thee, nor thine on me!	0
pray you ,  sir ,  stand up; i am sure you are not launcelot ,  my boy .	0
now, hamlet, listen.	0
i do ,  and surely it is a sleepy language ,  and thou speak’st out of thy sleep .	0
please, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep; i might wake you up in a little while about business to my brother cassius.	0
i promise you ,  but for your company ,  i would have been abed an hour ago .	0
i’m sorry to have to say this— help me away from here ,  dear charmian !	0
i haven’t seen him recently .	0
wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep - biter come by some notable shame ?	0
let me suffer your anger if it isn’t so .	0
o, he lights too.	0
give in, sweet hermia;—and, lysander, give up your crazy claim to my future bride.	0
he sent me word that ,  whether i liked it or not ,  he liked it fine .	0
count claudio ,  when do you plan to go to church and be married ?	0
i won’t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me .	0
did he take interest ?	0
go ahead ,  swear to that ,  so you’ll be damned to hell for lying .	0
of lusty earls: grandpré and roussi ,  faulconbridge and foix ,  beaumont and marle ,  vaudemont and lestrale .	0
what cannot be preserved when fortune takes, patience her injury a mockery makes.	0
draw and come .	0
before my body i throw my warlike shield !	0
who will thank us?	0
the first that there did greet my stranger - soul was my great father - in - law ,  renownèd warwick ,  who spake aloud ,   “ what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence ?  ”  and so he vanished .	0
lord ,  let me never have a cause to sigh ,  till i be brought to such a silly pass !	0
what do you think about that ?	0
affliction is enamour’d of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity.	0
o, yes, and soundless too, for you have stol'n their buzzing, antony, and very wisely threat before you sting.	0
i don’t know what else it could be .	0
is my lord angry ?	0
pardon ,  master .	0
all this ”  ?	0
macbeth is ripe for the picking .	0
why doth it not then our eyelids sink ?	0
farewell ,  good charles .	0
what is ,  my lord ?	0
good morrow to you both.	0
he doth ,  for he did bid antonius send word to you he would be there tomorrow .	0
that now sweno ,  the norways' king ,  craves composition .	0
isn’t it strange ,  canidius ,  that he could cross the ionian sea so quickly from tarentum and brundusium and take toryne ? —have you heard about this ,  sweet ?	0
tell him that by his license fortinbras craves the conveyance of a promised march over his kingdom .	0
may i have a word with you ?	0
when all the uproar is over ,  when the battle has been lost and won .	0
you know, antonio, how much i have wasted my money by putting on a fancier appearance than my small funds could support; i don’t come to you now to ask that you forgive my debts, because my chief concern is to make good on these great debts which my behavior, sometimes reckless and wasteful, has left me broke.	0
kind and dear princess !	0
tis true, most worthy signior; the duke's in council, and your noble self, i am sure, is sent for.	0
tell me right now and stop fooling: where’s the money ?	0
he hasn’t yet spent the wedding night with her; and she is joy for the gods.	0
but as well ?	0
admired miranda!	0
o day !	0
let’s meet as little as we can .	0
regards to theseus, our renowned duke!	0
i’m ready to hear you .	0
keep thy word .	0
for doting, not for loving, pupil mine.	0
crown him ?	0
to find out you.	0
their defeat grew by their own actions.	0
lady olivia told her servant malvolio to kick you out of the house .	0
march to the bridge .	0
has she told benedick how she feels ?	0
what ?	0
come, wrack!	0
is it so ,  indeed ?	0
what's the news ?	0
only for poor men ?	0
are you of good or evil?	0
it’s torture ,  not mercy .	0
at your service ,  madam .	0
i am one ,  my liege ,  whom the vile blows and buffets of the world have so incensed that i am reckless what i do to spite the world .	0
aboard ,  aboard ,  for shame !	0
well ,  that’s an  stay ,  fellow .	0
well contented .	0
lights ,  lights ,  get us some lights !	0
break not your sleeps for that .	0
i will not hold thee long .	0
alas ,  she has no speech .	0
o notable prostitute !	0
that’s a lame answer .	0
he heareth not ,  he stirreth not ,  be moveth not; the ape is dead ,  and i must conjure him .	0
and to what ?	0
and o you mortal engines ,  whose rude throats the immortal jove's dread clamors counterfeit ,  farewell !	0
let four captains bear hamlet like a soldier to the stage ,  for he was likely ,  had he been put on ,  to have proved most royally .	0
there’s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving  “ rosalind ”  on their barks .	0
sweet men ,  come to him .	0
bloody ,  bawdy villain !	0
if this uncouth forest yield anything savage ,  i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .	0
yes ,  my lord ,  and of calf - skins too .	0
yes ,  cassius .	0
this for him .	0
yes ,  i’m sure he’s dead .	0
who's there?	0
make an attempt.	0
despair and die !	0
my ears have yet not drunk a hundred words of that tongue's utterance ,  yet i know the sound .	0
but ,  o grief ,  where hast thou led me ?	0
why, that the moor first gave to desdemona; that which so often you did bid me steal.	0
take her to my tent .	0
those who can discipline themselves to undertake such a heavenly path for piety are blessed three times; but those who are in a convent to avoid marriage grow ,  live ,  and die ,  in single blessedness .	0
i was told that you were violent ,  proud ,  and sullen .	0
the king rises .	0
is this true ,  nerissa ?	0
beshrew my very heart ,  i think you are happy in this second match ,  for it excels your first; or if it did not ,  your first is dead—or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use of him .	0
indeed !	0
for brutus' sake, i’m grateful to you.	0
sir ,  don’t grieve; you are welcome nevertheless .	0
i that am cruel am yet merciful; i would not have thee linger in thy pain.	0
i never did her any ,  to my knowledge .	0
and i won’t be there either . —edmund ,  i’m told you’ve acted like a true son to your father .	0
shake off this downy sleep ,  death’s counterfeit ,  and look on death itself !	0
i can hardly forbear hurling things at him .	0
orlando .	0
report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .	0
where is my mother?	0
there’s hope in ’t yet .	0
it’s richard who sent us here to slaughter you .	0
by my brotherhood, the letter was not a social one, but a message of great importance, and failing to deliver it may do a lot of damage.	0
what a tunneler !	0
pull off my beard ?	0
your reason?	0
my barons and relatives, from this point forward you are earls, the first that scotland ever named to such an honor.	0
i’m a friend ,  a friend who knows you well .	0
twill not he seen in him there .	0
i do not, till you practise them on me.	0
take yourself a convent.	0
i repeat ,  spread the rumor that anne ,  my wife ,  is sick and likely to die .	0
i'faith ,  sweet love ,  i was coming to your house .	0
hey !	0
will you tell me that ?	0
by all means .	0
i’m finished .	0
sweetheart !	0
with any strong or vehement importunity .	0
zounds ,  i’ll entreat no more .	0
you look pale and wild, and these signs some bad luck.	0
the duke of cornwall ,  my master and patron ,  is arriving tonight .	0
go ,  change into a spirit ,  and come here invisibly: go ,  come here with care !	0
give me some wine ,  fill full .	0
where are they supposed to come ?	0
but a harsh hearing when women are froward .	0
run after that obnoxious messenger ,  the duke’s servant .	0
fled to england ?	0
do i only live outside of your good pleasure ?	0
see ,  who comes here ?	0
what fight was here ?	0
i warrant your honour .	0
good lads ,  how do you both ?	0
just now ,  my lord .	0
what have we here ?	0
this is the silliest thing i’ve ever seen .	0
so i welcome this wind freely .	0
alack ,  alack ,  edmund ,  i like not this unnatural dealing .	0
now, by this hand, i gave it to a youth,— a kind of boy; a little scrubbed boy, no higher than thyself, the judge's clerk; a prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee; i could not for my heart deny it him.	0
are you going to write antony about this ?	0
most lamentable day ,  most woeful day that ever ever i did yet behold !	0
he is ,  my lord ,  and safe in leicester town ,  whither ,  if it please you ,  we may now withdraw us .	0
who are the late commissioners ?	0
but ships are only boards of wood ,  sailors only men; there are land - rats and water rats ,  land - thieves and water - thieves , —i mean pirates , —and then there is the peril of waters ,  winds ,  and rocks .	0
romeo !	0
you all saw that on the lupercal feast day i offered him a king’s crown three times ,  and he refused it three times .	0
tell me ,  who is this knight ?	0
bruisèd pieces ,  go .	0
this is unbelievable !	0
how hast thou lost thy breath ?	0
i leave him to you .	0
what committed?	0
if you got what you deserved ,  you would learn some respect .	0
i am hers .	0
take your place .	0
nay then ,  i’ll run .	0
a very weak monster .	0
in doing the service and the loyalty i owe you, i am well paid.	0
o monstrous world!	0
are you so gospeled to pray for this good man and for his issue ,  whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave and beggared yours forever ?	0
oh ,  then belike you fancy riches more .	0
don’t stay here ,  go away .	0
she was only dead ,  my lord ,  as long as her slander lived .	0
oh ,  that’s not true ,  my lord .	0
yes ,  sir ,  we hope so .	0
nothing ,  good sir ,  except to help sir cobweb scratch my head .	0
alas ,  their love may be called appetite ,  no motion of the liver ,  but the palate ,  that suffer surfeit ,  cloyment ,  and revolt; but mine is all as hungry as the sea ,  and can digest as much .	0
now pile your dust upon the quick and dead till of this flat a mountain you have made to o'ertop old pelion or the skyish head of blue olympus.	0
messala !	0
answer me directly .	0
all right ursula ,  as beatrice arrives ,  we’ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but benedick .	0
what news ,  my lord ?	0
he asks her to do what god  say she will be a high and mighty queen .	0
not explicitly ,  but so what ?	0
have you not set lysander ,  as in scorn ,  to follow me and praise my eyes and face ?	0
doesn’t that make you want to cry ?	0
here comes another troop to seek for you .	0
this is for your master’s sake ,  not mine .	0
he doesn’t long for the dawn as we do .	0
angels are bright still ,  though the brightest fell .	0
if that the turkish fleet be not ensheltered and embayed ,  they are drowned .	0
truly, my name is cinna.	0
o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill !	0
no ,  madam .	0
murder and treason!	0
he that is yours, sweet lady.	0
o, so light a foot will never wear out the everlasting sharpening stone.	0
quick !	0
so, uncle, there you are.	0
to our shores throng many doubtful hollow - hearted friends ,  unarmed and unresolved to beat them back .	0
at least tell me where you’re going .	0
saw you my lord ?	0
i would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .	0
what dost thou mean ?	0
on the condition that publius shall not live ,  who is your nephew ,  mark antony .	0
please ,  come to his house with me .	0
that’s uncivilized and unnatural !	0
i often came where i did hear of her ,  but cannot find her .	0
so is the most difficult loss.	0
young though i am ,  i’ve been observing these three blowhards closely .	0
well ,  susan is with god; she was too good for me .	0
is she as fiery a shrew as they say ?	0
get out of here ,  good fleance ,  run ,  run ,  run !	0
oh ,  my poor brother !	0
we will ourselves provide .	0
macbeth .	0
don’t you know he has ?	0
hearty thanks .	0
you’ve judge his worth ,  and our great need of him ,  very well .	0
i beg you, when you see that act begin, even with the very criticism of your soul watch my uncle.	0
the more fool you for laying on my duty .	0
cassio shall take my place .	0
how comes this trick upon him?	0
baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .	0
o, well done!	0
we have lost best half of our affair .	0
just now we put him in the abbey over here ,  and now he’s over there .	0
but oh ,  how vile an idol proves this god !	0
you had too much water, poor ophelia, and therefore i’ll hold back my tears, but it is still our trick, nature holds her habits, let shame say what it will.	0
lend me thy cloak ,  sir thomas .	0
if a christian wrong a jew, what should his sufferance be by christian example?	0
what do you want ,  fellow ?	0
tis a lost fear: man but a rush against othello's breast, and he retires.	0
show me a mistress that is passing fair ,  what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who pass'd that passing fair ?	0
you’re too bitter .	0
i’ faith ,  i am sorry that thou art not well .	0
come ,  come ,  wrestle with thy affections .	0
my deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy ,  arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was—my trust which had no limit ,  an infinite confidence .	0
how did you escape?	0
though it be pity to see such a sight ,  it well becomes the ground .	0
when she landed at the port ,  antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .	0
yes ,  shylock ,  i’ll put my seal to this promise to pay .	0
come ,  tailor ,  let us see these ornaments .	0
he holds me well; the better shall my purpose work on him.	0
if thou wilt needs damn thyself ,  do it a more delicate way than drowning .	0
titania sleeps there sometimes at night ,  lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .	0
begin you to grow upon me ?	0
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .	0
i am not to you known ,  though ,  in your state of honor i am perfect .	0
we’ll go along together ,  and ere we have thy youthful wages spent ,  we’ll light upon some settled low content .	0
monster ,  come ,  put some lime upon your fingers ,  and away with the rest .	0
he’s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things—when it falls down the mountain ,  every little object goes down with it .	0
see ,  see ,  our honored hostess !	0
didn’t you speak to it ?	0
you are your father’s daughter .	0
cassio ,  my lord !	0
shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar ?	0
the lord in heaven bless you ,  noble harry !	0
you have the sacred power to cure both of us .	0
and you have mercy too!	0
i'll go along ,  no such sight to be shown ,  but to rejoice in splendour of my own .	0
the only thing that i’ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house ,  the phoenix ,  for lunch .	0
that i ask again ,  for nothing can be ill if she be well .	0
if you knew the reason ,  you’d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay .	0
isn’t that him ?	0
i will in cassio's lodging lose this napkin, and let him find it.	0
a friend .	0
i will ,  my lord .	0
i’m really a pitiful singer .	0
stand away from the body .	0
i'll tell you what you shall do .	0
you do but dally .	0
my lord shall never rest; i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; his bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; i'll intermingle everything he does with cassio's suit.	0
shame come to romeo!	0
is it not like the king?	0
nay ,  for a need ,  thus far come near my person: tell them when that my mother went with child of that insatiate edward ,  noble york my princely father then had wars in france ,  and ,  by true computation of the time ,  found that the issue was not his begot ,  which well appearèd in his lineaments ,  being nothing like the noble duke my father .	0
why i should fear i know not ,  since guiltiness i know not .	0
but wherefore could not i pronounce  “ amen ”  ?	0
its own color .	0
here i am ,  theseus .	0
ay ,  let the county take you in your bed .	0
if i live to see it ,  i’ll never trust his word again .	0
alas, how shall this bloody deed be explained?	0
i must tell you then .	0
that do i long to hear .	0
the things men do daily ,  not knowing what they’re doing !	0
i won’t any hooked instruments .	0
there’s a strong fellow ,  menas .	0
faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.	0
mark me with what violence she first loved the moor, but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies.	0
on thursday ,  sir ?	0
tyrrel ,  i mean those bastards in the tower .	0
how have you made division of yourself ?	0
all but metellus cimber, and he's gone to seek you at your house.	0
no ,  i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .	0
and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us .	0
iago .	0
do you love me, master?	0
for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night.	0
heigh-ho!—peter quince!	0
what does that mean ?	0
back, foolish tears, back to your native spring.	0
there will be rain tonight.	0
dost thou know the difference ,  my boy ,  between a bitter fool and a sweet fool ?	0
have you not read, roderigo, of some such thing?	0
the queen ,  my lord ,  is dead .	0
on such a full sea are we now afloat ,  and we must take the current when it serves ,  or lose our ventures .	0
sometimes i’ll turn into fire !	0
you poisonous slave ,  fathered by the devil himself through your wicked mother ,  come out !	0
i cannot tell what you and other men think of this life ,  but ,  for my single self ,  i had as lief not be as live to be in awe of such a thing as i myself .	0
beautiful ladies, you drop holy bread in the way of starved people.	0
away ,  away ,  be gone !	0
may the evil one take me if i meant it like that !	0
thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense ,  so forcible is thy wit .	0
think about it .	0
you wouldn’t know enough to be afraid of traps .	0
what were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?	0
i thank you all .	0
what dost thou say ?	0
shall i re-deliver your answer like that?	0
o shame!	0
the king doth wake tonight and takes his rouse, keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels, and as he drains his draughts of rhenish down, the kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out the triumph of his pledge.	0
you have not been to bed then?	0
as the indifferent children of the earth.	0
so be calm .	0
o, i am spoil'd, undone by villains!	0
well ,  i won’t .	0
one scene of it comes near the circumstance ,  which i have told thee ,  of my father's death .	0
according to an agreement ,  i should wear it myself .	0
please ,  your grace ,  tell me what crime i have committed .	0
beautiful ladies ,  please don’t treat me badly .	0
pretty too!	0
you see an ass-head of your own, do you?	0
fillet of a snake that lived in a bog, in the caldron boil and bake; eye of newt, and toe of frog, wool of bat, and tongue of dog, a black snake’s forked tongue, and its cousin’s sting, lizard's leg, and owlet's wing, for a charm of powerful trouble, like a hell-broth, boil and bubble.	0
why ,  she challenges me like a muslim would challenge a christian .	0
what a change is here!	0
well ,  aren’t you a good man ?	0
get you a place.	0
leave her to god and her own guilt .	0
that's not an office for a friend, my lord.	0
there is no power in venice can alter a decree establishèd .	0
help ,  help !	0
these vows are hermia's.	0
i thank you .	0
as it ebbs ,  the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain ,  and shortly comes to harvest .	0
here is the will, and under caesar's seal.	0
i therefore testify again ,  that he worked on her with some mixtures powerful over the blood ,  or with some dram that produced this effect .	0
thus do i ever make my fool my purse; for i mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, if i would time expend with such a snipe but for my sport and profit.	0
oh ,  ”  he said ,   “ did you fall on your face ?	0
it’s always better to get rid of what you’re scared of than to be afraid .	0
descend, for you must be my torchbearer.	0
for i never saw true beauty till this night.	0
what about the boy malcolm ?	0
i prithee, bear some charity to my wit; do not think it so unwholesome.	0
shut up .	0
but oops ,  when i let go of your hand ,  i let go of the biggest joke of all .	0
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous, and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?	0
why ,  'tis found so .	0
fare you well, my liege.	0
now ,  as you are a roman ,  tell me true .	0
god bless your grace with health and happy days .	0
then my love is humble .	0
do you lie so low ?	0
find him ,  titinius ,  while i go ahead to meet the noble brutus ,  thrusting this report into his ears .	0
of all the days in the year, i became a grave-maker the day that our last king hamlet overcame fortinbras.	0
no messenger but thine ,  and all alone tonight we’ll wander through the streets and note the qualities of people .	0
and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not .	0
o heavy day !	0
if it were ,  you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think i’d sold my farm to buy my crown .	0
we know thy charge ,  brakenbury ,  and will obey .	0
and what is this useless ceremony of kings ?	0
sir ,  sir ,  that can’t be true .	0
here ,  sir !	0
i marvel our mild husband not met us on the way .	0
of what color ?	0
yes ,  that’s the one .	0
can your man keep a secret?	0
does your other mouth call me?	0
in my stars i am above thee ,  but be not afraid of greatness .	0
but you’re lying out in the cold .	0
within this three mile may you see it coming; i say, a moving grove.	0
my good lord ,  i still need you to like me .	0
but ,  indeed ,  if you don’t find him within this month ,  you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby .	0
my lord bassanio ,  let him have the ring ,  let his deservings ,  and my love withal ,  be valued 'gainst your wife's commandment .	0
i’m happy to meet you ,  my lady and my wife .	0
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.	0
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth, because then it will have no end.	0
i think it is in macedon where alexander is porn .	0
we shall find a time ,  audrey .	0
pray heavens he be; for i have served him, and the man commands like a full soldier.	0
love me or love me not ,  i like the cap ,  and it i will have ,  or i will have none .	0
you may ,  mark antony .	0
a norman.	0
but i'll tighten the strings that make this music ,  until it’s as honest as i am .	0
a lively young one !	0
i think, in faith, she loves me.	0
the fire seven times tried this ,  seven times tried that judgment is ,  that did never choose amiss .	0
show!	0
killing pigs .	0
i mean ,  an we be in choler ,  we’ll draw .	0
thou hast me ,  if thou hast me ,  at the worst ,  and thou shalt wear me ,  if thou wear me ,  better and better .	0
i’m sure he had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i last saw him .	0
i’d be as right for the job as you are ,  and i’d do it more easily ,  since i’d have good will on my side .	0
ay ,  and a kind one too .	0
the devil damn you black, you cream-faced loon!	0
that same villain romeo.	0
what if i do obey?	0
what’s going on here ?	0
so bless thee ,  master .	0
are you content, jew?	0
othello, the strength of the place is best known to you; and although we have there a force that is more than adequate, yet public opinion, a sovereign mistress of effects, say we need a safer voice, like you.	0
love’s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .	0
till then ,  lead thou first .	0
well ,  i have done .	0
i do not think thou canst ,  for then thou wast not out three years old .	0
by my troth ,  nerissa ,  my little body is aweary of this great world .	0
the things i need are all on the ship .	0
so, fare you well.	0
dismiss me .	0
what impossible subject will he make easy next ?	0
i’m sure he’s been kidnapped .	0
but when i came ,  some minute ere the time of her awaking ,  here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead .	0
is he unable to repay the money ?	0
lysander's love ,  that would not let him bide ,  fair helena ,  who more engilds the night than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light .	0
no ,  don’t hit him ,  lieutenant !	0
know i these men that come along with you?	0
most high ,  most mighty ,  and most powerful caesar ,  metellus cimber falls before you most humbly .	0
worthy cawdor!	0
what treasure had he ,  my lord ?	0
an i may hide my face, let me play thisbe too.	0
you were to blame ,  i must be plain with you ,  to part so slightly with your wife's first gift; a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger ,  and so riveted with faith unto your flesh .	0
ok. go ahead.	0
i do follow here in the chase ,  not like a hound that hunts ,  but one that fills up the cry .	0
not one ,  my lord .	0
how begot ,  how nourished ?	0
what ,  did they never whisper ?	0
drink when i order you ,  servant - monster .	0
that were some spite; my invocation is fair and honest: in his mistress’ name, i conjure only but to raise up him.	0
sirs ,  take up the corpse .	0
my lord ?	0
didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand?	0
come ,  vaughan .	0
a friend .	0
toad ,  that has spent thirty one days and nights under cold stone ,  from whose sweat a sleeping venom was gotten ,  boil you first in the charmed pot !	0
ebbing men indeed most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth .	0
hurry up ,  my jewish friend .	0
no; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens.	0
if you enjoy looking at your awful deeds ,  take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .	0
he is at hand ,  and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master .	0
i wish i were senseless ,  sir ,  so that i wouldn’t feel your punches !	0
an upright judge, a learned judge!	0
if you could ,  doctor ,  analyze the urine of my land ,  find her disease ,  and purge it to a sound and former health ,  i would praise you to the very echo ,  that should praise again .	0
whose was it?	0
ha !	0
please let me go .	0
macbeth !	0
renounce it ,  sight !	0
i’m old and foolish .	0
tis but an hour ago since it was nine ,  and after one hour more ’twill be eleven .	0
and in assemblies too .	0
the turk with a most mighty preparation makes for cyprus .	0
murder!	0
what did you enact ?	0
fight me ,  coward !	0
thou liest .	0
this is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .	0
but two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .	0
wherein the toged consuls can propose as masterly as he .	0
to have no separation between this part he played and the man he played it for, he had to become the absolute duke of milan.	0
goats and monkeys !	0
you are the queen ,  your husband's brother's wife ,  and ,  i wish it wasn’t so ,  but you are my mother .	0
indeed, that is out of the air.	0
how ?	0
methinks sometimes i have no more wit than a christian or an ordinary man has .	0
oh spite!	0
he, woman; i say thy husband.	0
a cry more tuneable was never holla'd to ,  nor cheer'd with horn ,  in crete ,  in sparta ,  nor in thessaly .	0
well ,  i’ll hurry and put these papers where you told me .	0
peradventure ,  to make it the more gracious ,  i shall sing it at her death .	0
knock ,  knock .	0
my lord ,  his throat is cut .	0
you naughty ,  deceitful man ,  what’s your trade ?	0
she confessed .	0
if it does pass ,  the church will lose more than half of what it possesses ,  because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy ,  pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights ,  six thousand two hundred squires ,  and a hundred well - supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers ,  old - age pensioners ,  the poor ,  and those too weak or sick to work .	0
you’re really on time .	0
the boy gives warning something doth approach.	0
what’s the matter with you ,  madam ?	0
i’ll follow this good man ,  and go with you; and ,  having sworn truth ,  ever will be true .	0
it is silliness to live when to live is torment; and then we have a prescription to die when death is our physician.	0
o ,  sir ,  i will not be so hard - hearted .	0
this was a way to thrive ,  and he was blest; and good luck is blessing ,  if men don’t steal it .	0
who could refrain ,  that had a heart to love ,  and in that heart courage to make ’s love known ?	0
o worthy stephano!	0
look you ,  these are the stops .	0
no ,  believe me ,  'tis very cold; the wind is northerly .	0
benvolio ,  who began this bloody fight ?	0
if i had been any god of power, i would have sunk the sea on the earth, before it would have swallowed the good ship and the souls that were her cargo.	0
and i like helen, till the fates me kill.	0
show .	0
what is this ?	0
write from us to him, postposthaste dispatch.	0
pray heaven it is state matters ,  as you think ,  and no plot or no jealous reason concerning you .	0
he’s too good to have any compassion for you .	0
i should not urge thy duty past thy might; i know young bloods look for a time of rest .	0
those island - bred skeletons ,  terrified for their bones ,  are an offensive sight on the morning field .	0
to kill the boys with the luggage !	0
i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement .	0
virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes.	0
where are his arguments now, his pens, his cases, his subpoenas, and his tricks?	0
i can’t make myself a man by wishing i were ,  so as a woman i’ll die ,  from grieving .	0
give o'er the play .	0
twas you we laughed at .	0
in thunder ,  lightning ,  or in rain ?	0
come, come, nerissa; for i long to see quick cupid's post that comes so mannerly.	0
when ?	0
my excellent good friends !	0
thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince, taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law, and turn'd that black word death to banishment.	0
therefore thou sleep’st so sound .	0
how are you ,  sir toby belch ?	0
neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .	0
said you so ?	0
they have in england a coin that bears the figure of an angel stamped in gold ,  but that’s insculped upon .	0
is this face hero’s ?	0
a gullible father and a brother who’s so innocent that he can’t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him—these are the two fools i need for my plan to work .	0
i’m glad .	0
we cannot all be masters ,  nor all masters cannot be truly followed .	0
o my dear niece ,  welcome thou art to me ,  even daughter ,  welcome in no less degree .	0
witness the hole you made in caesar's heart ,  crying  “ long live !	0
now ,  were not i a little pot and soon hot ,  my very lips might freeze to my teeth ,  my tongue to the roof of my mouth ,  my heart in my belly ,  ere i should come by a fire to thaw me .	0
my lord !	0
only to watch that title become worthless ,  as her mother has .	0
dost thou hear me ,  old friend ?	0
not me, believe me.	0
follow her closely, watch her well, i beg you.	0
now ,  if you love me ,  stay .	0
right away ,  caesar .	0
i’ll have him away tonight.	0
how did my master die ,  strato ?	0
i never spake with her in all my life .	0
i will bestow him ,  and will answer well the death i gave him .	0
the text is foolish .	0
well then ,  good bye ,  my lord .	0
so don’t spend one night away from this house .	0
has he, masters?	0
i speak but in the figures and comparisons of it .	0
i couldn’t pay my debt to the jew on the due date .	0
before you make  my lord ,  you could really help me out now .	0
tonight, my lord?	0
you shall be a  “ logger - head .  ”  good faith ,  it’s morning .	0
where are they ?	0
i mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.	0
what other rites are you going to give her ?	0
or is it some abuse, and no such thing?	0
do you believe his tenders ,  as you call them ?	0
in the time since he left egypt ,  he could have traveled an even longer distance .	0
your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .	0
goodbye then ,  hero .	0
the like is on her arm .	0
well ,  her name’s a word ,  and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .	0
romeo’s a dishclout to him .	0
i’ll stand ,  and so will trinculo .	0
are you my daughter ?	0
call them again .	0
let’s not leave him out.	0
it’s a monster !	0
how am i false?	0
add thereto a tiger's chaudron ,  for the ingredients of our cauldron .	0
in the meantime ,  think about how i can do you good and give you what you want .	0
here comes my wife now .	0
in faith ,  i will .	0
what, ho!	0
why ,  i pray you ,  is not  “ pig ”  great ?	0
fare you well .	0
to all ,  and to him we miss ,  and all to all .	0
no ,  if you’ll speak ,  i’ll rant as well as you .	0
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother: thus when i shun scylla ,  your father ,  i fall into charybdis ,  your mother: well ,  you are gone both ways .	0
tis too bad ,  too bad .	0
hold ,  there’s expenses for thee .	0
here ,  sweet lord ,  at your service .	0
what do you mean ?	0
let me try: if there’s a buck who needs a doe tell him rosalind will do .	0
where is my gracious lord of canterbury ?	0
why ,  what’s the matter ?	0
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!	0
what’s that trumpet for ?	0
be this the whetstone of your sword .	0
will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher by the ears?	0
when the talk was about the poisoning?	0
the pound of flesh that i want from him was very expensive .	0
there’s the respect that makes calamity of so long life .	0
we are spoiled and yonder he is !	0
what else ?	0
you need to learn what ants know well about winter—there’s no point in slaving away if there’s no hope for profit .	0
the son and heir of old tiberio .	0
lucius ,  who’s that knocking ?	0
come to think of it ,  i thought i felt a scab there .	0
you’re tigers ,  not daughters .	0
their shadows seem like a killing canopy under which our army lies ,  ready to surrender .	0
is love a tender thing?	0
you turn my eyes into my very soul ,  and there i see such black and grainy spots as will not leave their color .	0
it is, my lord.	0
why ,  what a monstrous fellow art thou ,  thus to rail on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee !	0
come hither ,  good volumnius .	0
yes .	0
my lord ,  my lord !	0
away ,  old man .	0
how did this trick come on him ?	0
is she to be buried in christian burial when she willfully seeks her own salvation ?	0
oh, lucilius!	0
what are you doing ?	0
even now a tailor called me in his shop and showed me silks that he had bought for me ,  and therewithal took measure of my body .	0
hang not on my garments .	0
for they shall yet belie thy happy years that say thou art a man .	0
instead ,  lend it to me as your enemy .	0
he wore his beaver up .	0
why then ,  you are in love .	0
there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper, that steals the colour from bassanio's cheek; some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man.	0
find thou the means ,  and i'll find such a man .	0
come one more .	0
but they’re siding with a better wrestler than myself .	0
your shoes is not so good .	0
but fare you well ,  i have some business .	0
if, in your wisdom, you can’t help me, only say that my solution is a wise one, and right now, with this knife, i'll help solve it.	0
here comes brabantio and the valiant moor.	0
trust me ,  i take him for the better dog .	0
in this way ,  a conscience can make cowards of us all ,  and in this way the natural color of making up your mind is covered with the pale shadow of thinking ,  and projects of great substance and significance ,  and in this regard ,  their movement turns erratic ,  and lose the name of action .	0
what ,  all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?	0
and tell the dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .	0
but i pray you ,  ergo ,  old man ,  ergo ,  i beseech you ,  talk you of young master launcelot ?	0
as i get to leech him ,  i will show some mercy .	0
i charge you ,  in the name of god ,  be careful what you say .	0
why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?	0
most worthy gentleman ,  i ,  and my friend ,  have by your wisdom been this day acquitted of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof ,  three thousand ducats ,  due unto the jew ,  we freely cope your courteous pains withal .	0
sir ,  in argier .	0
the moon shines bright: in such a night as this, when the sweet wind gently kissed the trees, and they made no noise, in such a night, troilus i think climbed the walls of troy, and sighed his soul toward the grecian tents, where cressida lay that night.	0
thou wast born of woman.	0
go ,  get out !	0
and now, good friends, as you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, give me one poor request.	0
there are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the english with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order .	0
so out went the candle and we were left darkling .	0
no then, let the devil wear black, for i’ll have a suit of black fur.	0
methought i was ,  and methought i had ,  but man is but a patched fool ,  if he will offer to say what methought i had .	0
are your doors locked?	0
by the gods, you shall digest the venom of your spleen, though it do split you, for, from this day forth, i'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, when you are waspish.	0
don’t you know me, father?	0
listen to me ,  madam .	0
say it is done ,  and i will love thee and prefer thee for it .	0
marry, god forbid!	0
i have wept inside, or should have spoken before this.	0
but if you fail ,  you have to leave immediately .	0
what may this mean that thou ,  dead corse ,  again ,  in complete steel ,  revisits thus the glimpses of the moon ,  making night hideous ,  and we fools of nature so horridly to shake our disposition with thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ?	0
it is here ,  hamlet .	0
get yourself to a convent .	0
now all the young men of england are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .	0
foul deeds will rise ,  though all the earth o'erwhelm them ,  to men’s eyes .	0
tell us what happened today that put caesar in such a serious mood .	0
but really ,  are you the one who’s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of rosalind ?	0
i did say so when first i raised the tempest .	0
most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labour of his pilgrimage !	0
yeah ,  is the worst well ?	0
did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?	0
for no man, sir.	0
i will ,  my lord; i pray you pardon me .	0
my books and instruments shall be my company ,  on them to look and practice by myself .	0
then i know my answer must be made .	0
when it appears to you where this begins ,  turn your displeasure that way ,  for our faults can never be so equal that your love can equally move with them .	0
faith ,  no; as you may season it in the charge .	0
it’s bad news when a country is ruled by a child .	0
o ,  wilt thou darkling leave me ?	0
i humbly thank you ,  sir .	0
he’s bound unto octavia .	0
what's in a name?	0
damn it ,  who’s there ?	0
i'd rather kill myself.	0
what lady's that, which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight?	0
i can’t live by pretending anymore .	0
yes ,  and briefly .	0
where is my lord ,  the duke of gloucester ?	0
then, do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours?.	0
i don’t think he has been marked for drowning: his complexion is perfect for being hanged.	0
peace, you’d better stop.	0
we heard it very clearly .	0
very well ,  my lord .	0
we will hear more of this story later.— egeus, i will override your demands; these couples shall eternally be knit by and by with us in the temple.	0
are you gone like that ,  my love ,  my lord ?	0
therefore be double-damned, swear you are honest.	0
with all my heart .	0
no braver than this ?	0
make room!	0
i’ll never be satisfied with romeo until i see him  .	0
neither of them would take anything but the two rings .	0
i remember a fight ,  but not why we were fighting .	0
let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .	0
but stay, o spite!	0
the sister to my wife ,  this gentlewoman ,  thy son by this hath married .	0
go to !	0
what is the time o' th' day ?	0
which he’ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .	0
if it please the eye of one ,  it is with me as the very true sonnet is ,   “ please one ,  and please all .  ”   why ,  how dost thou ,  man ?	0
no one else would .	0
you and i ,  and honest casca ,  we have epilepsy—we’ve fallen .	0
ha, ha, ha!	0
where are they?	0
down with the capulets !	0
do poor tom some charity ,  whom the foul fiend vexes .	0
holy gonzalo ,  honorable man ,  my eyes ,  even sociable to the show of your eyes ,  cry like yours .	0
she's dead .	0
go to ,  go to .	0
nothing.	0
transparent helena !	0
i have done no more to caesar than you shall do to brutus .	0
i would she were as lying a gossip in that ,  as ever knapped ginger ,  or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband .	0
as wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed with raven's feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both !	0
heaven doth truly know it .	0
yea, a daniel!	0
well ,  then ,  we’re awake .	0
it hath the primal eldest curse upon ’t ,  a brother’s murder .	0
i love him dearly ,  and i shall continue to favor him .	0
i would forget it fain; but o, it presses to my memory like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds!	0
art thou indeed ?	0
this is the man ,  this is antonio ,  to whom i am so infinitely bound .	0
oh ,  caesar ,  read mine first ,  for my petition affects you more directly .	0
you are resolute ,  then ?	0
why did you it ?	0
tell me, othello.	0
my lord bassanio ,  let him have the ring .	0
because pyramus is a good - looking man ,  the most handsome man that you could find on a summer’s day ,  a lovely gentlemanly man .	0
o the pernicious wretch !	0
my master hath appointed me to go to saint luke’s to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix .	0
pah !	0
no, not an oath.	0
but if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof ,  we can get that .	0
or else this was a savage spectacle.	0
i would it might prove the end of his losses .	0
husband ?	0
and so we will ,  provided that he win her .	0
not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and played some tricks of desperation .	0
ok !	0
then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .	0
in what ,  my dear lord ?	0
where is your husband?	0
oh bloody richard !	0
the nasty devil’s biting my butt .	0
let it be their comfort that we are coming there.	0
my name’s stephano ,  and i’ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at belmont before sunrise .	0
what would you write about me ,  if you should praise me ?	0
i'll know his disposition when he knows the right time.	0
god be wi' you .	0
ring the alarum bell!	0
you are a saucy boy.	0
it would cost you a night in bed to take the edge off me.	0
an thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords.	0
i am not treacherous .	0
well ,  let’s get to our work .	0
now to my mother !	0
when a woman is virtuous ,  talents like these just make her better .	0
i do bite my thumb, sir.	0
the baron of fife had a wife; where is she now ?	0
i would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.	0
if to have done the thing you gave in charge beget your happiness ,  be happy then ,  for it is done .	0
i do attend here on the general and think it no addition ,  nor my wish ,  to have him see me womaned .	0
do you remember her face ?	0
why do you say that ?	0
there lies the duke asleep ,  and there the keys .	0
am i not in the right ,  old jephthah ?	0
now ,  i swear ,  she is a gentile and no jew .	0
if you’re stephano ,  touch me and speak to me .	0
he is at hand ,  and pindarus is come to do you salutation from his master .	0
oh ,  by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo .	0
so chrish save me ,  i will cut off your head .	0
stay here ,  titinius .	0
and what if they won’t go ?	0
goodbye ,  i'll be a better talker by dinner .	0
nor i .	0
there's comfort yet; they are assailable .	0
then whistle to me as signal that you hear something approaching.	0
i pray you ,  leave me .	0
through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind .	0
aside .	0
good sir ,  this ring was given me by my wife; and ,  when she put it on ,  she made me vow that i should not sell ,  or give ,  or lose it .	0
i’m annoyed lately with different passions, ideas that only i can know, which are perhaps seen in my behavior; but don’t let my good friends be upset— cassius, you’re one of them— or try to understand my indifference any further than that poor brutus, at war with himself, forgets to show friendship to other men.	0
true .	0
o villainous!	0
when thou wakest ,  if she be by ,  beg of her for remedy .	0
you’re the one i have to obey .	0
his folly ,  helena ,  is no fault of mine .	0
i’m positively stuffed with air ,  i eat so much of it .	0
never ,  my lord .	0
oh ,  my dear mistress ,  i won’t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest .	0
right on cue .	0
it is the very error of the moon; she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad.	0
and joy comes well in such a needy time.	0
and yet for aught i see ,  they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing .	0
look ,  how he makes to caesar .	0
who delivered it ?	0
therefore be patient .	0
my cousin means signor benedick of padua .	0
i have spoke thus much ,  to mitigate the justice of thy plea ,  which if thou follow ,  this strict court of venice must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there .	0
king stephen was a worthy peer, his breeches only cost him a dollar; he held them six cents all too expensive, with that he called the calm tailor.	0
there needs no ghost ,  my lord ,  come from the grave to tell us this .	0
stop, daughter.	0
i have a good eye ,  uncle .	0
swagger ?	0
will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing?	0
you ought to be ashamed of yourself !	0
my lord, his majesty sent a message to you by young osric, who tells him that you will meet him in the hall.	0
i’ll about and drive away the vulgar from the streets .	0
how can we tell which of us is the oldest ?	0
how it did grieve macbeth!	0
not today ,  o lord ,  oh ,  not today ,  think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown .	0
how now ,  old lad ?	0
you’re a lover .	0
so the fool follows after .	0
none, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.	0
you told me you hated him.	0
let me play the lion too.	0
nor i. i would not there reside to put my father in impatient thoughts by being in his eye.	0
i will ,  caesar .	0
a full half hour.	0
hello ,  my headstrong daughter !	0
ok ,  enough of that .	0
fly ,  my lord ,  fly !	0
make peace with god ,  for you must die ,  my lord .	0
i bought an oil of a mountebank, so mortal that, only dip a knife in it, where it draws blood, no super-potion so rare, collected from all antidotes under the moon that have always worked, can save the thing from death and this is only with a scratch.	0
no ,  it’s true ,  or if it’s not ,  i’m a villain .	0
let me choose; because as i am, i live in torture.	0
the king's in bed.	0
it’s your music ,  madam ,  from your house .	0
o ,  think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?	0
things have fall'n out ,  sir ,  so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter .	0
have you come by night, and stolen my love's heart from him?	0
your honor’s players ,  hearing your amendment ,  are come to play a pleasant comedy ,  for so your doctors hold it very meet ,  seeing too much sadness hath congealed your blood ,  and melancholy is the nurse of frenzy .	0
of what kind should this cock come of ?	0
but tell me true ,  are you not mad indeed ?	0
yours in the ranks of death .	0
experience ,  manhood ,  honor ,  ne’er before did violate so itself .	0
sit down and eat ,  and welcome to our table .	0
come ,  i’ll show you your bridal chamber .	0
remember march, the ides of march remember.	0
heaven preserve you!	0
if not ,  it’s true ,  this parting was well done .	0
and ,  gentle friends ,  let’s kill him boldly but not wrathfully .	0
now ,  charmian !	0
you had musty victual ,  and he hath holp to eat it .	0
no ,  my good lord .	0
i have a reasonable good musical ear; let’s sing and dance .	0
why, the rumors are all saying that antonio has a ship of rich cargo wrecked on the narrow seas; i think they call the place the goodwins, a very dangerous, flat, and fatal place, where the dead bodies of many tall ships are buried, as they say, if my gossip reporter is an honest woman of her word.	0
i think it be thine indeed ,  for thou liest in't .	0
why should titania cross her oberon ?	0
to be once in doubt is to be resolved .	0
yield ,  or you die .	0
it eases the spirit .	0
how say you?	0
no .	0
there’s not a piece of feather in our host— good argument ,  i hope ,  we will not fly— and time hath worn us into slovenry .	0
tis not so sweet now as it was before .	0
bear it coldly but till midnight and let the issue show itself .	0
drown cats and blind puppies !	0
antony .	0
no ,  let the sweet tongue lick ridiculous vain glory ,  and bend the obvious hinges of the knee where poverty may follow flattery .	0
or to be naked with her friend in bed an hour or more, not meaning any harm?	0
i’ll speak to him now .	0
tell me, good my friend, what torch is over there that wastes giving his light to grubs and eyeless skulls?	0
that skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once.	0
this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.	0
a beast that lacks the gift of reason, would have mourned longer— married my uncle, my father's brother, but no more like my father than i am like hercules.	0
oh dear!	0
mankind is so beautiful !	0
this is too long.	0
o !	0
this is old .	0
have you sent someone to bottom's house ?	0
antonio, gratify this gentleman, for, in my mind, you are much bound to him.	0
now ,  antony ,  our hopes are answered .	0
flute ,  you must take thisbe on you .	0
if anything of sorrow or wonder ,  stop your search .	0
she died ,  my lord ,  but whiles her slander lived .	0
bate ,  i beseech you ,  widow dido .	0
let’s ha' ’t ,  good grumio .	0
there's a problem in these sighs.	0
you had too much water ,  poor ophelia ,  and therefore i’ll hold back my tears ,  but it is still our trick ,  nature holds her habits ,  let shame say what it will .	0
dear me!	0
hazard for lead?	0
i’m sure it would’ve ,  i’m sure it would’ve .	0
i will, sir.	0
now ,  by this hand ,  i gave it to a youth ,  a kind of boy ,  a little scrubbed boy no taller than you ,  the judge's clerk; a chattering boy that asked for it as a fee; i could not ,  for my heart ,  deny him the ring .	0
then i must think you wouldn’t want it.	0
i hope you get what you desire !	0
if you desire the spleen ,  and will laugh yourself into stitches ,  follow me .	0
i am maimed for ever .	0
no ,  alas ,  i found it ,  and i did give't my husband .	0
wonderful !	0
the better that your lordship please to ask .	0
let me go with him .	0
do you not hear him ?	0
three times today my foot - cloth horse did stumble ,  and started when he looked upon the tower ,  as loath to bear me to the slaughterhouse .	0
o ,  ho !	0
goodly lord ,  what a wit - snapper are you !	0
my spells are working well ,  my spirits are obeying me ,  and everything is right on schedule .	0
a god of a god ?	0
i’m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .	0
what may you be?	0
well .	0
anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes .	0
no ,  he’s in florence .	0
she will wither and come to a bad end .	0
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie?	0
why, love?	0
fill your purse with money.	0
a villain kills my father; and for that, i, his sole son, do this same villain send to heaven.	0
and stand indebted ,  over and above ,  in love and service to you forever .	0
when ?	0
out, out, you loose woman, fortune!	0
if you would know your wronger ,  look on me .	0
but all the story of the night told over ,  and all their minds transfigured so together ,  more witnesseth than fancy's images ,  and grows to something of great constancy ,  but howsoever strange and admirable .	0
adieu.	0
still harping on my daughter .	0
that’s what makes it  “ sensitive ”  news .	0
i pray thee ,  chide not .	0
i have heard it over ,  and it is nothing ,  nothing in the world— unless you can find sport in their intents ,  extremely stretched and conned with cru 'l pain to do you service .	0
and let him hold his fingers thus ,  and through that cranny shall pyramus and thisbe whisper .	0
thou marvell'st at my words, but hold thee still: things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.	0
say that i hope he never has cause to look for a new master .	0
my lord?	0
but she is now mark antony’s wife .	0
but hush ,  no more .	0
in love ?	0
what’s the news abroad ?	0
all for our vantage .	0
nay ,  we will slink away in supper time ,  disguise us at my lodging ,  and return ,  all in an hour .	0
so ,  with two seeming bodies but one heart ,  two of the first ,  like coats in heraldry ,  due but to one and crownèd with one crest .	0
here comes the little villain .	0
come, my coach!	0
am i part of you but, as it were, in sort or limitation,— to keep you company at meals, sleep in your bed, and talk to you sometimes?	0
i pray you ,  turn the key and keep our counsel .	0
my good lord— you’ve always been a liar .	0
oh ,  are you here ,  iago ?	0
my lord ,  they’re waiting for you to give your daughter away to claudio .	0
i prithee ,  who ?	0
it is in ourselves that we are like this or like that .	0
why have you become so rude ?	0
but one, poor one, one poor and loving child, but one thing to rejoice and take comfort in, and cruel death has taken it from my sight!	0
pretty ophelia !	0
why are we talking about this ?	0
alas ,  good gentleman !	0
and why ,  my lady wisdom ?	0
what wouldst thou now ?	0
hunting what ,  curio ?	0
as i told you before, i am subject to a tyrant, sorcerer, that has cheated me of the island by his cunning.	0
pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the christian go .	0
shall we give o'er and drown ?	0
the two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .	0
and but one word with one of us ?	0
if i know this, and know the whole world too, i can shake off at pleasure that part of tyranny that i endure.	0
then ,  gentle brother ,  get you in again .	0
fast !	0
i will be gone ,  sir ,  and not trouble you .	0
i say ,  my daughter is my flesh and blood .	0
i know i can do it .	0
no matter.	0
thou know’st not me .	0
my next is ‘most fair pyramus.’ heigh-ho!	0
guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .	0
cesario ,  you do not keep promise with me .	0
oh ,  i’m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !	0
benedick ,  didst thou note the daughter of signior leonato ?	0
then i guess i was misled .	0
oh ,  did he ?	0
away !	0
o proud death, what feast is being held in your eternal cell, that you have killed so many princes so bloodily all at the same time?	0
but who’s coming here ?	0
why should their liberty than ours be more ?	0
you jig ,  you amble ,  and you lisp; and nickname god's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance .	0
wouldst thou aught with me?	0
how have you known the miseries of your father ?	0
on my honor and by my word ,  if you outstay the ten days ,  you will die .	0
you, sir, always told me i couldn’t do anything without bidding.	0
give me details .	0
tis even so .	0
welcome, wanderer.	0
and she can cry ,  sir—oh ,  how she can cry !	0
thou baggage ,  let me in .	0
dined at home ”  ?	0
then he says i didn’t return some ships he loaned me .	0
hail ,  mortal !	0
tell me ,  that i may sack the hateful mansion .	0
this chest threatens; men that gamble everything do it in hope of a better advantage: a golden mind doesn’t stoop to shows of scum; then i won’t give or gamble anything for lead .	0
therefore ,  good brutus ,  be prepared to hear ,  and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection ,  i your glass will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of .	0
yes ,  that thou didst .	0
not yet .  ”  well ,  the time has come .	0
or the antidote for stinging plants or hollyhocks .	0
what i have done that might your nature ,  honour ,  and exception roughly awake ,  i here proclaim was madness .	0
my sword and i will earn our place in history .	0
neither death nor life will stop me from coming .	0
good or bad news ,  that thou com’st in so bluntly ?	0
go back with her ?	0
now, how dost thou look now?	0
i have brought the king's son ashore by himself, and i left him cooling off with the air that blows gently in a remote spot of the island, and sitting, his arms sadly folded like this.	0
england would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .	0
no, no, he is dead; go to thy deathbed; he never will come again.	0
he is arrived .	0
but if you be remembered ,  i did not bid you mar it to the time .	0
welcome back to denmark ,  my lord .	0
stay near me so i’ll remember .	0
now lies he there ,  and none so poor to do him reverence .	0
doesn’t benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with beatrice ?	0
it is to be all made of sighs and tears ,  and so am i for phoebe .	0
i stumbled when i saw .	0
nor send you out of the way ?	0
my next is ‘most fair pyramus . ’ heigh - ho !	0
wilt thou have me ?	0
there is no more to say ?	0
you cannot ,  if my heart were in your hand; nor shall not ,  whilst 'tis in my custody .	0
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned ,  bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell ,  be thy intents wicked or charitable ,  thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee .	0
revenges burn in them ,  for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man .	0
i am sure you both of you remember me .	0
but you’re no such man .	0
here is a letter found in the pocket of the slain roderigo, and here another.	0
things growing are not ripe until their season; so i, being young, till now ripe not to reason; and touching now the point of human skill, reason becomes the marshal to my will, and leads me to your eyes, where i o'erlook love's stories, written in love's richest book.	0
murder and treason !	0
what?	0
my brother thinks highly of you ,  and because of his affection ,  has helped arrange your marriage—but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy .	0
why ,  what care i ?	0
don’t talk back to me .	0
let that be enough for you .	0
my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses .	0
heaven bless us !	0
where is my husband ?	0
and these few precepts in thy memory look thou character .	0
come on .	0
yes ,  my lord .	0
i refuse to accept that .	0
leave us alone .	0
these past fifteen years you have been living in a dream ,  and even when you were awake ,  it was as though you slept .	0
that of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker; each minute teems a new one .	0
i came here with a fool’s head on my shoulders and now i’m leaving with two . —goodbye ,  sweet lady .	0
let us go in; and charge us there upon inter'gatories, and we will answer all things faithfully.	0
god bless you ,  sir .	0
do you think i meant country matters ?	0
but come, i'll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach, which stays for us at the park gate; and therefore haste away, for we must measure twenty miles to-day.	0
no ,  you’ll see ,  four days will quickly turn into four nights .	0
o churl!	0
question it ,  horatio .	0
this afternoon, sir?	0
nay ,  when i have a suit— wherein i mean to touch your love indeed ,  it shall be full of poise and difficult weight ,  and fearful to be granted .	0
come, sirs.	0
i cannot think you are my son.	0
what's he that now is going out of door ?	0
she give it cassio !	0
my regan counsels well .	0
the fight is between our masters ,  and we men who work for them .	0
master ,  you were so focused on the girl herself ,  i wonder if you missed the main point here .	0
and talk like a parrot ?	0
it’s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .	0
but ,  alas ,  caesar must bleed for it !	0
we don’t come here with the intention of making you happy .	0
but jealous souls will not be answered so .	0
where is my page?	0
the fat, sloppy woman cries.	0
have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak ,  sorrow - ravaged voice ?	0
don’t hear it, duncan, for it is a sorrowful omen of death that summons you to heaven or to hell.	0
observe his inclinations in yourself.	0
marry ,  to—come ,  captain ,  will you go ?	0
her name is margery, indeed: i'll be sworn, if thou be launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.	0
prodigious birth of love it is to me that i must love a loathed enemy .	0
my stupid heart ,  which i’m leaving behind here .	0
this dream has been interpreted all wrong .	0
miranda.	0
yes ,  yes .	0
i have looked on the world for twenty eight years ,  and since i could distinguish between a benefit and a disadvantage ,  i’ve never found man that knew how to love himself .	0
your fortune stood on the chests there, and so did mine, as it works out; because courting here until i worked up a sweat, and swearing promises until my mouth was dry with oaths of love, at last, if her promise lasts, i got a promise of this beautiful one here to have her love, provided that you were lucky enough to get her mistress.	0
the worser that you give me the addition whose want even kills me .	0
i hear him mock caesar’s luck ,  which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath .	0
it had a violent beginning ,  and you shall see an answerable separation— put only money in your purse . —these moors are changeable in their wills .	0
where is the king ?	0
what ,  must our mouths be cold ?	0
but don’t be easily won over .	0
the thought whereof doth ,  like a poisonous mineral ,  gnaw my inwards ,  and nothing can or shall content my soul till i am evened with him ,  wife for wife .	0
had he a hand to write this ,  a heart and brain to breed it in ?	0
meet me and gratiano at gratiano's house in about an hour .	0
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me .	0
i cannot speak enough of this content .	0
he no more shall see my face .	0
how dost thou and thy master agree ?	0
in mine ignorance your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, stick fiery off indeed.	0
marry ,  if he that writ it had played pyramus ,  and hanged himself in thisbe's garter ,  it would have been a fine tragedy .	0
but who was that man ?	0
in sooth ,  i know not why i am so sad .	0
on ,  on ,  on ,  on ,  on !	0
you make me strange even to the disposition that i owe ,  when now i think you can behold such sights ,  and keep the natural ruby of your cheeks when mine is blanch'd with fear .	0
my man grumio !	0
you wouldn’t have dared ,  out of fear for your life .	0
do you hear ?	0
my lord, i don’t know what i should think.	0
bring forth men - children only ,  for thy undaunted mettle should compose nothing but males .	0
a madness most discreet ,  a choking gall ,  and a preserving sweet .	0
even so?	0
mistress!	0
good gentlemen ,  give him a further edge ,  and drive his purpose on to these delights .	0
ha ,  ha !	0
no stony tower ,  no brass walls ,  no airless dungeon ,  no iron chains can contain a strong mind .	0
in the end i left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room ,  with the stinking water covering them up to their chins .	0
caesar should be a beast without a heart if he should stay at home today for fear .	0
o ,  help ,  ho !	0
she whom i love now has grace for grace and love for love allowed .	0
a gentleman ?	0
remind richard of this ,  and he will weep .	0
indeed i did ,  my lord .	0
and then it started, like a guilty thing upon a fearful summons.	0
and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have .	0
two nights together had these gentlemen ,  marcellus and barnardo ,  on their watch ,  in the dead waste and middle of the night ,  been thus encountered: a figure like your father ,  armed at point exactly ,  cap - à - pie ,  appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them .	0
eventually, as patient as the female dove when that her golden twins are discovered, his silence will sit drooping.	0
i will speak to this fellow .	0
why, man, i saw bassanio under sail; with him is gratiano gone along; and in their ship, i am sure, lorenzo is not.	0
wondrous heavy .	0
i have a pain upon my forehead here.	0
you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger ,  and think it pastime .	0
i’m afraid it will make you too hot ,  too .	0
my lord of gloucester hath conveyed him hence .	0
something too much of this.	0
it is a sin to heaven, a sin against the dead, a sin to nature, most ridiculous to reason, whose common theme is death of fathers, and who still has cried, from the first corpse to the man who died just today, ”this must be so.” we beg you, give up on this unusual grief, and think of us as of a father.	0
he received caesar’s letters ,  and he is coming .	0
come, let me wipe thy face.	0
if thou art fickle ,  what dost thou with him that is renown'd for faith ?	0
the strings, my lord, are false.	0
work ,  work your thoughts ,  and therein see a siege .	0
if i see anything tonight why i should not marry her ,  tomorrow in the congregation ,  where i should wed ,  there will i shame her .	0
every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout ,  waiting to capture me .	0
o, i am slain!	0
o ,  let him pass .	0
your honor’s is unhealthy talk .	0
speak .	0
the bark is ready and the wind at help ,  th' associates tend ,  and everything is bent for england .	0
out of my sight !	0
death and damnation !	0
then you must speak of one that loved not wisely, but too well; of one not easily jealous, but, being aggravated, confused in the extreme; of one whose hand, like the low judas, threw a pearl away that was richer than all his tribe; of one whose sad eyes, albeit unused to a crying spell, drop tears as fast as the arabian trees drop their medicinal gum.	0
i’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come .	0
you may do it off the top of your head ,  because it’s nothing but roaring .	0
why should i play the roman fool and die on mine own sword?	0
i beg you ,  do so .	0
why didn’t the jerk come back to me when i called him ?	0
even though birnam wood really did come to dunsinane ,  and i’m fighting a man not of woman born ,  i’ll fight to the end .	0
what are you doing here?	0
our sport shall be to take what they mistake; and what poor duty cannot do, noble respect takes it in might, not merit.	0
well ,  let’s sit down and listen to barnardo tell us .	0
another general shout !	0
the last of all the romans ,  fare thee well !	0
what does he say of brutus?	0
o spite!	0
oh ,  that’s very nice !	0
well ,  you can go now .	0
he’s given his empire to a whore ,  and now they’re gathering kings to wage a war .	0
o cassio ,  cassio ,  cassio !	0
o ,  it’s the same in my mistress' case ,  just in her case !	0
tell me .	0
if you’re so fond of her sin, give her permission to offend; because, if it doesn’t affect you, it affects nobody.	0
of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turn'd, and not a false turn'd true.	0
a very honest - hearted fellow ,  and as poor as the king .	0
by my life ,  i do .	0
when in your motion you are hot and dry— as make your bouts more violent to that end— and that he calls for drink ,  i'll have prepared him a chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping ,  if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck ,  our purpose may hold there .	0
fiend angelical!	0
will you play this recorder ?	0
i am maim'd forever .	0
it’s all over now ,  and so am i .   let’s forgive each other .	0
and i too ?	0
isn’t that enough ?	0
o spartan dog, more evil than anguish, hunger, or the sea!	0
come ,  come ,  we’re worrying about the worst - case scenario .	0
tarry ,  jew .	0
this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo .	0
ay ,  and truly ,  you were best .	0
o, i see that nose of yours, but not that dog i shall throw it to.	0
that is done ,  sir; they have all stomachs .	0
by sea ,  what else ?	0
i’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .	0
are we betrayed before we have deserved it ?	0
oh ,  no ,  that was my lady’s voice .	0
what didst not like ?	0
my lord?	0
but let us rear the higher our opinion ,  that our stirring can from the lap of egypt’s widow pluck the ne’er lust - wearied antony .	0
go ,  some of you ,  and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is .	0
he shall do this, or else i take back the pardon that i just pronounced here.	0
should i perjure my soul by disobeying it ?	0
or did the letter make him emotional somehow ,  and this is the first time he’s done it ?	0
have you told him all her faults ,  hortensio ?	0
never !	0
forever and a day .	0
i have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking .	0
good madam!	0
sadness is only appropriate for funerals .	0
therefore my merchandise makes me not sad .	0
there's another .	0
and are all traitors like that?	0
the sooner, sweet, for you.	0
a most courteous exposition.	0
read the time there .	0
no ,  for that we should be coal miners .	0
i here do give thee that with all my heart which ,  but thou hast already ,  with all my heart i would keep from thee .	0
now i know him now.	0
i pray thee ,  get us some excellent music ,  for tomorrow night we would have it at the lady hero’s chamber window	0
don’t let me hold you up, cassius, go if you like; i'll leave you.	0
why, i will see thee at philippi then.	0
nay ,  he hath but a little beard .	0
the time is free .	0
continue ,  come to hecuba .	0
i afeard of him !	0
yes, with a heart as willing as slavery was ever willing of freedom: here's my hand.	0
i held the sword, and he ran into it.	0
no .	0
i don’t have it with me .	0
you don’t know ?	0
he did, from first to last.	0
out in the world ,  i’m like a drop of water ,  trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean .	0
what ,  is trusting a friend such a crime ?	0
yet be content .	0
and it’s very much lamented, brutus, that you don’t have any mirrors that will let you see your own hidden worthiness, any mirrors that you might let you see your shadow.	0
yes ,  believe me ,  and all his lords ,  the duke of milan ,  and his brave son being two of those lost .	0
but i am very sorry ,  good horatio ,  that i forgot myself to laertes ,  because ,  by the image of my cause ,  i can see myself in him .	0
she that would be your wife now ran from you .	0
it is the cause .	0
sir toby ,  madam ,  your kinsman .	0
if trembling i inhabit then, protest me the baby of a girl.	0
the duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own .	0
very good ,  my lord .	0
is it not strange ,  canidius ,  that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea and take in toryne ? —you have heard on ’t ,  sweet ?	0
please ,  young sir .	0
you ,  like an exorcist ,  have brought my dead spirit back to life .	0
the french ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .	0
he looks as though he’s in a great hurry !	0
he’s a coward and a coistrel that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o' th' toe like a parish top .	0
i’m afraid that may be the case ,  madam .	0
is there more work ?	0
he will, an if he live to be a man.	0
i repeat ,  he’s in love .	0
this day ,  great duke ,  she shut the doors upon me while she with harlots feasted in my house .	0
we two, my lord, will guard your person while you sleep, and watch for your safety.	0
say when .	0
a deed without a name.	0
andrew aguecheek ”	0
who here is so vile that he doesn’t love his country ?	0
thus ,  sir: although this lord of weak remembrance ,  this ,  who shall be of as little memory when he is earth'd ,  hath here almost persuaded— for he's a spirit of persuasion ,  only professes to persuade—the king his son's alive ,  ’tis as impossible that he's undrowned as he that sleeps here swims .	0
why ,  in good time .	0
what else ?	0
there were none principal .	0
good mercutio!	0
god’s benison go with you and with those that would make good of bad and friends of foes .	0
to have a foolish wife .	0
no more ,  cousin .	0
it is a creature that i teach to fight ,  to wind ,  to stop ,  to run directly on ,  his corporal motion govern'd by my spirit .	0
i shall serve you ,  sir ,  truly ,  however else .	0
my mother had a maid called barbara; she was in love; and the man she loved went crazy and left her .	0
i don’t wish to have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.	0
that it did ,  sir ,  in the very throat of me; only i paid him back for his lie; and ,  i think ,  being too strong for him ,  though he knocked me off my feet a few times ,  i still made a joke to throw him off .	0
the ,  shouldn’t i smother in the vault ,  where there is no fresh air ,  and i will die there ,  strangled ,  before my romeo comes ?	0
it’s late .	0
but you must learn to know such slanders of the age ,  or else you may be marvelously mistook .	0
o, what a rash and bloody deed is this!	0
villain ,  thou know’st not law of god nor man .	0
we will have vengeance for it ,  don’t worry about that .	0
she will not put up with loving language nor tolerate loving looks ,  nor does she care if a guy is rich .	0
for you ,  i give myself away and i’m ecstatic about the exchange .	0
come on, then; down, and swear.	0
how sad ,  for mercy !	0
i have brought him a present.	0
on the condition that your sister’s son ,  publius ,  also must die ,  mark antony .	0
help, help!	0
hey ,  naked guy— poor tom’s chilly .	0
i will find the time to cry for you ,  cassius ,  i’ll find the time .	0
alas, poor rogue!	0
i grant i am a woman, but withal a woman well reputed, cato's daughter.	0
he is ,  my lord ,  and safe in leicester ,  where ,  if you’d like ,  we can retreat to .	0
ah ,  the countess is coming !	0
what ,  octavia ?	0
i suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .	0
fetch the will hither ,  and we shall determine how to cut off some charge in legacies .	0
who's there, in the other devil's name?	0
never did mockers waste more idle breath.	0
if you can remember it, begin at this line, let me see, let me see.	0
when have i injured thee ?	0
it won’t last .	0
the law that threatened you with death becomes your friend and turns it into exile .	0
if you married my sister for her wealth ,  then for her wealth’s sake ,  treat her with more kindness .	0
so you are obliged to revenge, when you shall hear me.	0
if it be you that stir these daughters' hearts against their father ,  fool me not so much to bear it tamely .	0
i do not understand.	0
are we all ready ?	0
they’re coming .	0
ay ,  but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse ,  and therefore stood lamely in the verse .	0
insolent  oh ,  the good gods !	0
little’ again!	0
herein i see thou lov’st me not with the full weight that i love thee .	0
canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile ,  and touch thy instrument a strain or two ?	0
off with his son george’s head !	0
it should seem, then, that dobbin's tail grows backward; i am sure he had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i last saw him.	0
farewell.	0
listen ,  i’m going home tomorrow ,  sir toby .	0
i’ll challenge him .	0
i cannot think my sister in the least would fail her obligation .	0
now margaret’s curse has fallen on our heads ,  for standing by and doing nothing when richard stabbed her son .	0
hurry now ,  get the job done .	0
do you think i would be feeling as triumphant as i am if i didn’t know that our situation was secure ?	0
why ,  how now ,  ho !	0
none that i know will be ,  much that i fear may chance .	0
what sights, my lord?	0
grave sir ,  hail !	0
if she returns my jewels ,  i’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .	0
they’re as opposite as hot and cold .	0
now ,  herald ,  are the dead numbered ?	0
what is your will ?	0
you have lost no reputation at all ,  unless you repute yourself such a loser .	0
wilt thou ,  silvius ?	0
i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes.	0
god give him joy !	0
that’s the beginning of the day we see ,  but i don’t think we’ll see the end of it . —who goes there ?	0
nothing but songs of death .	0
if not ,  elsewhere they meet with charity .	0
it will be laid to us ,  whose providence should have kept short ,  restrain'd ,  and out of haunt this mad young man .	0
madam !	0
gone ?	0
i agree ,  his means of death ,  his obscure burial ,  no trophy ,  sword ,  no coat of arms over his bones no noble rites or state funeral ,  cry to be heard ,  from heaven to earth as it were ,  that i must call it into question .	0
and mine ,  with my heart in't ,  and now farewell till half an hour hence .	0
do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.	0
no ,  not to live .	0
let me be satisfied ,  is it good or bad ?	0
i will tell you why .	0
o cursed, cursed slave!	0
is it frailty makes mistakes like this?	0
wouldn’t it be better—since i’m unusually tall for a woman—to dress myself like a man ?	0
tis such another fitchew!	0
what noise startles in our ears ?	0
oh ,  my good lord ,  don’t make me insult music again with my awful singing .	0
what, have you din'd at home?	0
i’ll not fail ,  if i live .	0
meet me right away at the harbor .	0
could beauty ,  my lord ,  have better commerce than with honesty ?	0
then let us both be sudden .	0
greetings ,  my lady ,  and may god always be with you .	0
dost thou mean the crown ?	0
and a bad singer ,  my lord .	0
conscience and grace ,  to the deepest pit !	0
his body will lie in my tent tonight ,  with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .	0
live ,  and be prosperous; and farewell ,  good fellow .	0
handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief !	0
what he will do with it heaven knows ,  not i .  i nothing but to please his fantasy .	0
be the players ready .	0
by god ,  i’m going to tell the duke how slack you’ve been .	0
yes ,  right now .	0
know thus far forth: by accident most strange ,  bountiful fortune (now my dear lady) hath mine enemies brought to this shore .	0
the grey - ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night ,  check'ring the eastern clouds with streaks of light; and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day's path and titan's fiery wheels .	0
yes ,  why shouldn’t she ?	0
but being widow ,  and my gloucester with her ,  may all the building in my fancy pluck upon my hateful life .	0
so she was moved by it ?	0
call him in .	0
ay ,  and wisely .	0
methinks it is like a weasel.	0
out, of love?	0
locked in her tomb .	0
thy fates open their hands .	0
claudio !	0
my ear must pull it out .	0
four legs and two voices; a most delicate monster!	0
i know you can do better than that ,  but it’ll do for now .	0
don’t you see that i’m out of breath ?	0
if you had ,  the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you .	0
adieu ,  good mr .  depression .	0
yes ,  madam .	0
who, me?	0
how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves ! —who’s there ?	0
i shook your hands for that reason; but i was really distracted from the point by looking down on caesar .	0
thy false uncle— dost thou attend me ?	0
so shall you hear of carnal ,  bloody and unnatural acts; of accidental judgments ,  casual slaughters; of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause; and ,  in this upshot ,  purposes mistook fall'n on the inventors' heads .	0
in form and moving, how expressive and admirable!	0
i’ll do ’t ,  my lord .	0
in any case, let thisbe have clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails, for they shall hang out for the lion's claws.	0
being unprepared ,  our wishes became the servants to what we lacked ,  which has worked out very well .	0
a most scurvy monster!	0
he knows what ?	0
besides ,  they have burned and carried away all that was in the king’s tent ,  wherefore the king ,  most worthily ,  hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner’s throat .	0
a gentler judgment vanished from his lips, not your body's death, but your body's banishment.	0
is ’t possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her ?	0
let the king have the letters i have sent, and come to see me with as much haste as you would fly death.	0
i heard him say ,  brutus and cassius are rid like madmen through the gates of rome .	0
michael cassio ,  lieutenant of the moor othello ,  has arrived on shore .	0
the duke’s to blame in this .	0
run away ,  i pray you !	0
my father was no traitor .	0
what was it you told me of today ,  that your niece beatrice was in love with signor benedick ?	0
until then, enough.	0
where ,  where ,  messala ,  doth his body lie ?	0
no epilogue, i beg you, because your play needs no excuse.	0
o brave new world that has such people in't !	0
gentlemen ,  welcome to elsinore .	0
how goes the night ,  boy ?	0
did you and he agree to cassio's death?	0
give me that boy and i will go with you .	0
go away and let me die .	0
so he does indeed .	0
look what i have.	0
i’ll go to ireland .	0
i’m your little dog ,  demetrius .	0
what’s the news among the merchants ?	0
when that the poor have cried ,  caesar hath wept .	0
yes ,  that’s why you have to die .	0
love give me strength!	0
i beg you to stay with us ,  don’t go to wittenberg .	0
what's this ?	0
my mistress titania is in love with a monster .	0
i have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze but that this folly drowns it.	0
how hurting a lash that speech gives my conscience!	0
have they returned?	0
portia ,  what are you doing awake ?	0
give my love to my kind husband .	0
what is the matter, my lord?	0
nurse ,  will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?	0
none but his enemies .	0
you have broken my heart .	0
you ass !	0
for the table ,  sir ,  it shall be served in; for the meat ,  sir ,  it shall be covered; for your coming into dinner ,  sir ,  why ,  let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .	0
it’s stopped;—and surely ,  it’s for some god of the island .	0
what is the matter?	0
faith ,  her privates we .	0
well said ,  old mole !	0
where we are ,  there’s daggers in men’s smiles .	0
she's the worse for all this.	0
notable pirate !	0
why ?	0
believe me, i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes; and, but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are, it were enough to put him to ill thinking.	0
pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds ,  shylock ,  so he doesn’t bleed to death .	0
who's there?	0
lysander ,  look how i do quake with fear .	0
o, pardon, sir, it doth, and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day.	0
farewell ,  and thanks .	0
a right fair mark ,  fair coz ,  is soonest hit .	0
romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live.	0
away ,  get out of here .	0
farewell ,  good salisbury; and may good luck go with you .	0
my dear master ,  my captain ,  and my emperor ,  let me say ,  before i strike this bloody stroke ,  farewell .	0
will she go now to bed?	0
we'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.	0
the noise they’re making will wake up demetrius .	0
i would have her learn ,  my fair cousin ,  how perfectly i love her ,  and that is good english .	0
but sir ,  have you married my daughter without my consent ?	0
if i ever loved her ,  all that love is gone .	0
this lodovico is a proper man .	0
oh ,  ’twas a din to fright a monster’s ear ,  to make an earthquake !	0
it’s a deal .	0
win me and wear me !	0
what art thou ,  fellow ?	0
she deceived her father by marrying you; and when she seemed to shake and fear your looks, she loved them most.	0
how ?	0
please lock the door and keep quiet .	0
question your grace the late ambassadors with what great state he heard their embassy ,  how well supplied with noble counselors ,  how modest in exception ,  and withal how terrible in constant resolution ,  and you shall find his vanities forespent were but the outside of the roman brutus ,  covering discretion with a coat of folly ,  as gardeners do with ordure hide those roots that shall first spring and be most delicate .	0
hopefully when i get married ,  i’ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty .	0
murder ?	0
no ,  let's come in .	0
by st .  paul ,  ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless richmond’s soldiers could ,  dressed up in their most sword - proof armor .	0
and too soon marred are those made young mothers .	0
well ,  well ,  thou hast a careful father ,  child .	0
romeo !	0
i will kiss thy lips.	0
therefore be merry, cassio, for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away.	0
soft, who comes here?	0
three thousand ducats ,  for three months ,  and antonio bound .	0
no; he only totally misses the truth.	0
and hell chew on his bones !	0
are my deserts no better ?	0
a friend should bear his friend's infirmities, but brutus makes mine greater than they are.	0
yes .	0
i do entreat you ,  not a man depart ,  save i alone ,  till antony have spoke .	0
i want to measure the extent of your love ,  to see how far it stretches .	0
meet me later at the fortress.	0
yes ,  and mild ,  as he has said most knowledgeably .	0
two or three groan .	0
yes ,  we’re the privates in her army .	0
i’m putting myself in god’s hands ,  and with his help i plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder .	0
you are the queen ,  your husband's brother's wife ,  and—would it were not so—you are my mother .	0
come ,  we'll get some sleep .	0
yet more quarrelling with occasion !	0
i know not.	0
hark !	0
o me!	0
methinks i see my cousin’s ghost seeking out romeo ,  that did spit his body upon a rapier’s point .	0
i was adored once too .	0
but shall i live in hope ?	0
it’s not an insignificant happiness, therefore, to be well situated in regard to financial resources: having more than enough comes at some time or other to old men, but having a sufficient income lasts longer.	0
ho ,  guildenstern !	0
i’ll wait on them with all respect and duty .	0
this toast is for lepidus !	0
what is this, that rises like the issue of a king, and wears upon his baby brow the round and top of sovereignty?	0
here is a friar ,  and slaughter'd romeo's man ,  with instruments upon them fit to open these dead men's tombs .	0
by heaven i order you, speak!	0
you’ll be afraid to hear it .	0
what are you waiting for ,  lords of france ?	0
give it to me !	0
gentlemen, my master antonio is at his house, and wants to speak with both of you.	0
so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.	0
i will none .	0
the morn is fair .	0
but i yield to die.	0
well ,  i’m the man you’re speaking of .	0
urge the necessity and state of times ,  and be not peevish found in great designs .	0
signior brabantio, ho!	0
o ,  then i see you will part but with light gifts .	0
what's this?	0
had i not four or five women once that tended me ?	0
we therefore have great cause of thankfulness and shall forget the office of our hand sooner than quittance of desert and merit according to the weight and worthiness .	0
i have an interest in your hate's proceeding ,  my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding; but i'll amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine .	0
can you tell if rosalind ,  the duke’s daughter ,  be banished with her father ?	0
thy juliet is alive ,  for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead— there art thou happy .	0
the revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding .	0
no ,  it’d be a sin to think such a low thought .	0
if he is ready now, i am too, now or whenever, provided that i am so able as i am now.	0
macbeth !	0
believe me, love, it was the nightingale.	0
this is cinna .	0
dear master ,  listen to me .	0
they were traitors.	0
he shall, sir, if it pleases him.	0
i will say for you .	0
that’s why you sleep so soundly .	0
at that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books; or you can bash his skull with a log; or you can stab him in the belly; or cut his windpipe .	0
thy love !	0
what time is it ?	0
and with such maimed rites ?	0
here is thy fee .	0
he’s my prisoner .	0
i say, we will have no more marriages.	0
two months ago, there was a gentleman from normandy here, i’ve seen myself, and served against the french, and they can do well on horseback, but this gallant had witchcraft in it.	0
get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.	0
who comes here?	0
i have a pain upon my forehead here .	0
my worthy lord ,  your noble friends are missing you .	0
the duke greets you ,  general; and he requires your super - speedy appearance this instant .	0
how came these things to pass?	0
god's blessings go with you; and with those that would make a good situation out of a bad one and friends of foes!	0
why, now you speak like a good child and a true gentleman.	0
as caesar loved me ,  i weep for him; as he was fortunate ,  i rejoice at it; as he was valiant ,  i honor him; but ,  as he was ambitious ,  i killed him .	0
it’s the death of half the world .	0
darkness is stumbling out of the sun’s path like a drunk man .	0
for lo !	0
alas ,  iago ,  my lord hath so bewhored her ,  thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her ,  that true hearts cannot bear it .	0
i could teach you how to choose right, but then i’m breaking my oath; i’ll never do that; you may not win me; and if you don’t, you'll make me wish i had sinned, that i had broken my oath.	0
casca ,  by your voice .	0
we’ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .	0
good friends ,  sweet friends ,  don’t let me stir you up to such a sudden flood of rebellion .	0
i don’t know what you’re talking about .	0
what is that noise ?	0
i have slept, my lord, already.	0
the night has been unruly.	0
can you work in the earth so fast?	0
and breath'd such life with kisses in my lips that i reviv'd and was an emperor .	0
come ,  shall we fall to work ?	0
i found it in my bedroom; and he himself confessed just now that he dropped it there for a special purpose which would be bent to his desires.	0
fie ,  fie ,  lieutenant ,  you’ll be ashamed for ever .	0
hie to your chamber.	0
their story is bizarre and astounding ,  but it’s solid and consistent .	0
o treacherous villains !	0
tears seven times salt, burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!	0
and do but see his vice; 'tis to his virtue a just equinox ,  the one as long as the other .	0
what did you enact ?	0
indeed she's a most fresh and delicate creature.	0
why ,  what’s the matter ?	0
ay ,  my liege ,  so please you give us leave .	0
it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard speak, my lord.	0
one more thing ,  sir .	0
what place?	0
see'st thou this sweet sight ?	0
i beg your pardon for loving you too much .	0
you’ve got some petition to caesar, haven’t you?	0
but ,  for all that ,  to my thinking ,  he seemed eager to have it .	0
i like your joke ,  i swear .	0
signor bassanio ,  hear me .	0
why, sir, a carpenter.	0
thus has he—and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter, a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.	0
shall we their fond pageant see ?	0
what wilt thou do for her?	0
then he shook bassanio’s hand affectionately—and they separated .	0
if you do, i shall never love you after.	0
look at the three little dogs ,  tray ,  blanch ,  and sweetheart—all barking at me .	0
a friend .	0
come ,  go with me .	0
scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a bum - baily .	0
they’re out to get me ,  and i won’t stand for it !	0
dead .	0
i will not.	0
let me play the lion too .	0
she hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.	0
what simple thief brags of his own attaint ?	0
more pity that the eagle should be mewed while kites and buzzards prey at liberty .	0
moth!	0
say something .	0
my clerk hath some good comforts too for you.	0
don’t disturb his soul .	0
that’s my brave lord !	0
give me some light .	0
was that mine?	0
i know where i will wear this dagger then .	0
go to the pulpit, brutus.	0
i hear it now above me .	0
come ,  vial .	0
what do i care what curious eye lists my deformities?	0
i am sorry they offend you, heartily; yes, faith, heartily.	0
no, please, don’t let me play a woman; i have a beard starting t o grow.	0
they’ll kill us .	0
who commands them, sir?	0
my life will be too short ,  and every measure fail me .	0
there i deny my land service .	0
i’ll go ahead of you ,  sir .	0
he has almost supped .	0
romeo!	0
trust to ’t ,  bethink you .	0
oh ,  quick ,  or i am gone .	0
henceforward i am ever rul'd by you .	0
the enemy ,  marching along with them ,  will increase their numbers with them ,  and attack refreshed ,  reinforced ,  and encouraged; we shall cut him off from that advantage ,  if we face him at philippi ,  with these people behind us .	0
what ,  has his daughters brought him to this pass ? — couldst thou save nothing ?	0
how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !	0
well ,  it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly ,  too dark to be praised fairly ,  and too small to be praised greatly .	0
was that my father that went hence so fast ?	0
by foul play ,  as thou sayst ,  were we heaved thence ,  but blessedly holp hither .	0
here's decius brutus, he shall tell them so.	0
that i love her ,  i feel .	0
in the beautiful city of verona ,  where our story takes place ,  a long - standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence ,  and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .	0
and yet i do thee wrong to mind thee of it ,  for thou art framed of the firm truth of valor .	0
o, the sun shall never see that tomorrow!	0
in troth ,  i think i should ,  and undo't when i had done .	0
i said ,  an elder soldier ,  not a better .	0
where dost thou hide thy head?	0
tis well .	0
it was his bidding; therefore ,  good emilia ,  give me my nightgown ,  and goodbye .	0
so he does indeed .	0
that is exactly why we wanted you here ,  your lordship—to avoid the public carping and complaints .	0
fortune forbid my outside have not charmed her !	0
come hither, gentlemen, and lay your hands again upon my sword.	0
god bless you, sir!	0
good evening to your worship ,  good captain james .	0
what noise is here ?	0
give him a statue with his ancestors .	0
my resolution’s placed ,  and i have nothing of woman in me .	0
when laban and himself were compromis'd that all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied should fall ,  as jacob's hire; the ewes ,  being rank ,  in the end of autumn turned to the rams: and when the work of generation was ,  between these woolly breeders ,  in the act ,  the skilful shepherd pill'd me certain wands ,  and ,  in the doing of the deed of kind ,  he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes; who ,  then conceiving ,  did in eaning - time fall party - colour'd lambs ,  and those were jacob's .	0
alas ,  what cry is that ?	0
no ?	0
go where ,  my lord ? —cesario ,  my husband ,  stay here .	0
only how will you do for a father?	0
thus when i shun scylla your father ,  i fall into charybdis your mother .	0
she is ten times more gentle than her crabby father, and he's made of harshness.	0
i ,  who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals ?	0
fare you well ,  lord .	0
but i have words that would be howled out into the desert air ,  where hearing should not catch them .	0
so every holy spirit help me ,  as i have spoken all my best for you ,  and stood shocked at his displeasure over my free speech !	0
what conquest brings he home ?	0
if you agree with my opinion ,  when it is time ,  it’ll be more honor for you .	0
you should be whipping yourself ,  since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you’re punishing her .	0
when was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?	0
i come not ,  friends ,  to steal away your hearts .	0
i order you ,  go home .	0
now ,  tybalt ,  take back again the word  “ villain ”  that you just gave me; for mercutio's soul is only a little way above our heads ,  waiting for yours to keep him company .	0
honest ,  my lord !	0
a friend .	0
if she cannot entreat ,  i can compel .	0
seek him ,  bid him come here .	0
prithee, tonight lay on my bed my wedding sheets.	0
fortune is merry, and in this mood will give us any thing.	0
content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.	0
come, go we to the king.	0
thou art a soul in bliss ,  but i am bound upon a wheel of fire ,  that mine own tears do scald like molten lead .	0
no ,  for then we should be colliers .	0
here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned dane, drink off this potion!	0
the worst fault you have is to be in love .	0
is it your own desire to come here?	0
madam, i swear i use no clever words at all.	0
perdition catch my soul but i do love thee !	0
why ,  you scoundrel !	0
because if she is not honest ,  chaste ,  and true ,  there's no man happy; the purest of their wives is wicked as the leis about them .	0
vengeance ,  plague ,  death ,  confusion !	0
tis a good hand ,  a frank one .	0
now all the blessings of a glad father are all around you!	0
on, lusty gentlemen!	0
we'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors .	0
did ever dian so become a grove as kate this chamber with her princely gait ?	0
please don’t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .	0
his sword, which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam, seemed in the air to stick.	0
cassio !	0
and i must be from thence!	0
why ,  whither ,  adam ,  wouldst thou have me go ?	0
i have given you strong proof of my constancy, giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh.	0
stand !	0
why ,  what’s the problem ?	0
what’s wrong with you ?	0
nay, i'll go with thee, cheek by jowl.	0
what should such a fool do with so good a wife?	0
come ,  help me bang on the door ,  master .	0
treason !	0
belike they had some notice of the people how i had moved them .	0
a hit ,  a hit that was felt .	0
o ,  this is the poison of deep grief; it springs all from her father's death .	0
they are not near my conscience; their defeat does by their own insinuation grow.	0
it’s a capital offense for anyone from mantua to come to padua .	0
madam !	0
no more amazement .	0
hark !	0
the fault’s your own .	0
for my part ,  the sea cannot drown me .	0
when was it she last walked ?	0
just as when the sun rises and shipwrecking storms and terrible thunder stop, so from that man, who seemed to bring comfort, discomfort got worse.	0
captain jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman ,  that’s certain ,  one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare ,  i happen to know from his maneuvers .	0
this way doves with nimble wings draw love ,  and that’s why the wind - swift cupid has wings .	0
only i’m afraid your nature; it is too full of the milk of human kindness to a shortcut to power.	0
and i’ll go there straight to visit him.	0
where are those bastards ?	0
twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew dangerous conjectures in ill - breeding minds .	0
i’ve lost my name and title to a traitor .	0
one that was a woman ,  sir ,  but ,  rest her soul ,  she's dead .	0
nay ,  i hope .	0
your  “ love ”  is lying there .	0
still, caesar shall go out, because these predictions are not only for caesar but also for the world in general.	0
what ,  has this thing appeared again tonight ?	0
is he alone?	0
o me ,  lieutenant !	0
therefore, as i am supposed to, receive it from me.	0
lysander and i are running away from here .	0
now ,  i’m very pleased with it being outdoors ,  but in its not being at the court ,  it is boring .	0
indeed ?	0
is this not more than our imaginations?	0
alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself!	0
if you insist on trying my patience any further ,  then take out your sword right now .	0
o treason of the blood!	0
no.	0
nor anyone .	0
come ,  i'll go in with you .	0
ay ,  madam ,  from the reach of these my hands .	0
what’s the play called ?	0
i pay your poverty ,  and not your will .	0
i think i see my cousin's ghost looking for romeo who pierced his body with a sword's point .	0
you shall be more beloving than beloved .	0
help me out of here ,  quickly !	0
don’t be afraid of him ,  caesar; he's not dangerous; he’s a noble roman and has a good disposition .	0
it’s his handwriting ,  my lord ,  but i hope he didn’t mean what he wrote .	0
this supernatural cannot be ill, cannot be good.	0
the skies are painted with unnumbered sparks .	0
to cut his throat i' the church.	0
is this true ?	0
to deal with everything smoothly and evenly, this sudden sending him away must seem like a planned event.	0
the ground feels flat to me .	0
but to be frank, and give it thee again.	0
i rather tell thee what is to be fear'd than what i fear ,  for always i am caesar .	0
of the king's ship ,  the mariners ,  say how thou hast disposed ,  and all the rest o'th’ fleet .	0
when my cue comes ,  call me ,  and i will answer .	0
wouldst thou aught with me ?	0
but come ,  i’ll tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach ,  which stays for us at the park gate .	0
no ,  he’s in a place worse than hell .	0
mark him .	0
thank you ,  sir .	0
my good friends ,  hark !	0
listen !	0
most like .	0
one word more shall make me scold you, if not hate you.	0
i’ll be at charges for a looking glass and entertain a score or two of tailors to study fashions to adorn my body .	0
advise the duke where you are going ,  to a most festinate preparation .	0
richard ,  the duke of gloucester ,  hates you .	0
you are unkind, demetrius; be not so; for you love hermia.	0
amen .	0
at thy good heart's oppression.	0
isn’t it possible to understand in another tongue?	0
come over here ,  nurse .	0
i have made you crazy: and even with similar courage ,  men hang and drown themselves .	0
if you will take a homely man's advice ,  don’t be found here ,  here ,  with your little ones .	0
and when i don’t love you ,  chaos comes back .	0
please take them .	0
follow her .	0
call in the messengers .	0
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.	0
some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone .	0
as i told thee before ,  i am subject to a tyrant ,  a sorcerer ,  that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island .	0
my lord ?	0
i’m starting to feel murderous urges .	0
caesar ,  i bring thee word menecrates and menas ,  famous pirates ,  make the sea serve them ,  which they ear and wound with keels of every kind .	0
but let’s follow it ,  and then do our dirty work afterward .	0
hear the noble antony.	0
we'll e'en to't like french falconers ,  fly at any thing we see .	0
no ,  my lord .	0
hark you, sir.	0
no ,  cassius ,  for the eye sees not itself but by reflection ,  by some other things .	0
that guy’s funny .	0
i anger her sometimes, and tell her that paris is the properer man; but i'll warrant you, when i say so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world.	0
since birth and heaven and earth ,  all three do meet in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose .	0
commend me to your lady .	0
and when she speaks ,  is it not an alarum to love ?	0
but you can make amends now .	0
now, by my hood, a gentile and no jew.	0
really ?	0
o cassio ,  cassio ,  cassio !	0
but i have none .	0
i know not if't be true; but i for mere suspicion in that kind will do as if for surety.	0
goodbye.	0
my lord, here stays without, a messenger with letters from the doctor, new come from padua.	0
who's there ,  in the other devil's name ?	0
and are all traitors like that ?	0
that's even more evil .	0
you know tomorrow is the wedding day .	0
oh ,  on my soul ,  my cousin has been slandered falsely !	0
hear the noble antony .	0
don’t you see that i’m out of breath?	0
and now, who knows but you, lorenzo, whether i am yours?	0
sir topas ,  sir topas ,  good sir topas ,  go to my lady— out ,  hyperbolical fiend !	0
if you’re as poor a subject as he is a king ,  you definitely are poor .	0
give me my fan ,  peter .	0
make haste ,  lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .	0
why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable—the most precious things in your life ,  those strong bonds of love ?	0
take hence this jack and whip him .	0
if thou be merciful ,  open the tomb ,  lay me with juliet .	0
no one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this ,  then .	0
lay forth the gown .	0
yes ,  and brought off the field .	0
now ,  what news on the rialto ?	0
a good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike .	0
one more, and this the last: so sweet was ne'er so fatal.	0
no wonder ,  my lord .	0
stay !	0
back do i toss these treasons to thy head ,  with the hell - hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart—	0
it doesn’t matter if it’s in tune so long as it’s loud enough .	0
come caesar to the capitol tomorrow ?	0
portia ?	0
why do you dress me in borrow'd robes?	0
therein ,  ye gods ,  you make the weak most strong; therein ,  ye gods ,  you tyrants do defeat .	0
was this beautiful paper, this very excellent book, made to write “whore” on?	0
i won’t be kind to you .	0
no ,  orlando ,  men are like april when they’re wooing a girl—young ,  and passionate—but like december once they’re married and their passions have cooled .	0
come your ways .	0
this grisly beast ,  which lion hight by name ,  the trusty thisbe ,  coming first by night ,  did scare away ,  or rather did affright; and as she fled ,  her mantle she did fall; which lion vile with bloody mouth did stain .	0
talk about your serious speech over a gossip's bowl, because we don’t need it here!.	0
tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.	0
it’s true i heard a humming sound ,  a strange one ,  which woke me up .	0
o dear ophelia ,  i am sick at the number of my sighs ,  i don’t have the skill to calculate my groans .	0
what do you have to say to me now ?	0
let’s go offer up our lives	0
come ,  throw it o'er my face .	0
that’s a scary thought !	0
and therefore haste away ,  for we must measure twenty miles today .	0
well ,  petruchio ,  all this is very encouraging .	0
or neither ?	0
follow me ,  then ,  to a clear place .	0
goodbye .	0
and if the king were on it, what would i do?	0
he was quick mettle when he went to school .	0
come ,  let’s away to prison .	0
even though it’s early ,  there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor .	0
what's the news with you ?	0
let’s go .	0
sit down and rest .	0
lieutenant cassio will be on guard duty tonight .	0
this night .	0
what is my name?	0
to be your fellow you may deny me ,  but i’ll be your servant whether you will or no .	0
look, my lord, it comes!	0
most royal sir, fleance is 'scaped.	0
patience ,  good sir .	0
give me access to them ,  and soon you won’t have to worry about them anymore .	0
nay ,  i do bear a brain .	0
i was engaged to both of them .	0
what should such a fool do with so good a wife?	0
therefore be happy, cassio; because your lawyer would rather die than lose your case.	0
safely stow'd .	0
o bloody period!	0
where are you going ?	0
those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .	0
i should not see the sandy hour-glass run, but i should think of shallows and of flats; and see my wealthy andrew dock'd in sand, vailing her high-top lower than her ribs, to kiss her burial.	0
o rude unthankfulness !	0
o heavens !	0
what sum owes he the jew ?	0
go then ,  my mother; to thy daughter go .	0
i’m going to make you look sharp ,  laertes .	0
o ,  she was heavenly true !	0
what ?	0
sola !	0
but first ,  i will release the fairy queen .	0
then ’tis he: the rest that are within the note of expectation already are i’ the court.	0
no, guiltiness will speak even if tongues are out of use.	0
i know not what ’twas but distraction .	0
but the special thing about it is , —which is indeed almost beyond belief , — as many verified  “ special things ”  are .	0
if a christian wrongs a jew ,  what should his choice be by christian example ?	0
you come most carefully upon your hour .	0
yes ,  but who is he ?	0
my lord ,  there is a messenger waiting outside with letters from the doctor ,  just now arrived from padua .	0
i bet it’s a love letter !	0
last night ,  when that star up there ,  that's west of the north pole ,  had moved around to light that part of the sky where now it burns ,  marcellus and myself ,  the clock’s bell then tolling one ,  quiet ,  stop !	0
his son is thirty .	0
tis unnatural ,  even like the deed that's done .	0
that was my lady's voice.	0
horatio ,  when you read this ,  give these fellows some way to talk to the king .	0
it’s almost four .	0
what a fearful night is this!	0
so let high - sighted tyranny range on till each man drop by lottery .	0
do thou meet me presently at the harbor.	0
this honest creature doubtless sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.	0
i don’t know what you mean by that, but i’m sure caesar fell down.	0
cassio’s a handsome man .	0
not a dump we!	0
it will make you melancholy ,  monsieur jaques .	0
is it known who did this more than bloody deed ?	0
in sooth ,  you are to blame .	0
away, skinny man!	0
i'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.	0
why, i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer blink.	0
hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.	0
dost thou say so ?	0
i did not think you could have been so angry .	0
there’s a nicer piece of work right here .	0
romeo can, though heaven cannot.	0
it doesn’t seem so.	0
now he’s telling the story .	0
the duke will be here tonight ?	0
she's framed as fruitful as the free elements .	0
if knowing what to do were as easy as knowing what was good to do ,  chapels would have been churches ,  and poor men's cottages would have been princes' palaces .	0
there my lysander and myself shall meet .	0
i’m ready now to hear what my good cousin the dauphin has to say—for i hear that the greeting you bear is from him ,  not the king .	0
o all you host of heaven !	0
it’s a lot to ask of a maiden .	0
but for your private satisfaction ,  because i love you ,  i’ll tell you .	0
what’s the news among the merchants ?	0
o weary night, o long and tedious night, abate thy hours!	0
remember march ,  the ides of march remember .	0
come, let's go; all the strangers are gone.	0
thank you ,  ariel .	0
let us toward the king .	0
my reputation ,  iago ,  my reputation !	0
they are incensed.	0
peace . —who comes here ?	0
death is the best way to cover over her shame .	0
nor i.	0
as gaming, my lord?	0
one speak for both:—what would you ?	0
give your thoughts to yourself ,  and don’t act without thinking .	0
i was conceived by a woman ,  and i thank her very much for all her effort .	0
alas ,  poor harry of england !	0
till then ,  adieu ,  and keep this holy kiss .	0
he, being weak, most generous, and free from all trickery, will not think about swords, so that easily, or with a little mix up, you may choose a sword that’s not poisoned, and, in a pass during practice, kill him in revenge for your father.	0
this torture should make a loud noise in dismal hell.	0
feeling so the loss ,  cannot choose but ever weep the friend .	0
i have had a most rare vision .	0
tis they have put him on the old man’s death ,  to have th' expense and spoil of his revenues .	0
it was some devil .	0
one of them rates all that is won and lost .	0
or shall we on without apology ?	0
take it in what sense thou wilt.	0
do you think they’re married ?	0
it’s just midnight .	0
oh ,  heaven forgive me !	0
oh ho ,  are you there with me ?	0
as ignorant as dirt !	0
did he take interest?	0
heartily farewell .	0
go .	0
lovell ,  go as fast as you can to doctor shaw .	0
tis so ,  indeed .	0
but till that time come not thou near me .	0
i would do a lot to reconcile them ,  for the love i bear to cassio .	0
so you’ll be hanged at the state’s expense .	0
will you be prick'd in number of our friends, or shall we on, and not depend on you?	0
thou dost not mark me.	0
ratcliffe ,  come here .	0
hang there ,  my verse ,  in witness of my love .	0
please come with me .	0
leave me, friends.	0
so, kneel down, and beg mercy of the duke.	0
a plague on both your houses !	0
no, monster, not me.	0
tybalt ,  that murderer ,  which way ran he ?	0
give me my sin again.	0
does that mean he’s lazy ?	0
all school - days' friendship ,  childhood innocence ?	0
i am maimed forever.	0
what an idiot this guy is ! —you’re a rotten piece of work ! —i beg your highness ,  beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .	0
stanley ,  richmond is your wife’s son .	0
she instructs me well.	0
for your desire to know what is between us ,  o'ermaster ’t as you may .	0
quiet !	0
farewell ,  farewell .	0
do you know them?	0
then both ,  or one ,  or anything thou wilt .	0
wouldn’t that have been just as appropriate ?	0
well ,  i won’t take it any longer .	0
say either good or bad, and i'll wait for the details.	0
would i were satisfied !	0
the man in the moon!	0
oh ,  ophelia ,  i’m bad at poetry .	0
make your confession short .	0
somebody’s knocking .	0
my excellent good friends !	0
the bud from the moon - goddess’ plant has such force and blessed power over cupid's flower .	0
what an ogre you are to slander someone you don’t know ,  and who doesn’t know you !	0
why, what a king is this!	0
who is next ?	0
and with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?	0
an if the wind blow any way from shore ,  i will not harbor in this town tonight .	0
why ,  the end is he hath lost a ship .	0
only i yield to die.	0
from fife, great king, where the norweyan banners flout the sky and fan our people cold.	0
i'll put it on .	0
your worship's friend, and launcelot, sir.	0
doesn’t everyone want a wife like that ?	0
o, never shall sun that morrow see!	0
anon.	0
yet stay awhile ,  thou shalt not back till i have borne this corse into the market - place .	0
at your kind'st leisure .	0
god protect you from tornadoes ,  evil stars ,  and diseases !	0
what, i say, my foot my tutor?	0
your loving father, hamlet.	0
a knave teach me my duty !	0
are you speaking from your heart ?	0
humbly on my knee i crave your blessing .	0
i would believe it against a fortuneteller .	0
no, i am promised forth.	0
ay, every man away.	0
sir , — one: speak .	0
no one’s listening to you .	0
arm ,  arm ,  my lord .	0
danger knows full well that caesar is more dangerous than he .	0
my own flesh and blood to rebel!	0
what’s that ?	0
it eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have ,  such .	0
for my part, i have walk'd about the streets, submitting me unto the perilous night, and thus unbraced, casca, as you see, have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone; and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open the breast of heaven, i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it.	0
i can be discreet in honorable matters ,  ride a horse ,  run ,  tell a good story badly ,  and deliver a plain message bluntly .	0
i’ll never see ’t !	0
but god who has the plan of my journey on this sea, direct my sail!	0
as much to him ,  else is his thanks too much .	0
and ,  if not so ,  how should i wrong a brother ?	0
it shall be seven o'clock before i get on my horse .	0
ay ,  ay ,  three thousand ducats .	0
ay ,  hamlet .	0
o mighty caesar!	0
fall not a tear ,  i say .	0
what a crazy island this is .	0
i dare swear he is no hypocrite but prays from his heart .	0
you know that you are brutus that speak this ,  or ,  by the gods ,  this speech were else your last .	0
my good lord, tell it.	0
come, death, and welcome!	0
yes ,  you’re right .	0
what tributaries follow him to rome to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?	0
the very same.	0
that monster ,  custom ,  who all sense doth eat of habits evil ,  is angel yet in this ,  that to the use of actions fair and good he likewise gives a frock or livery ,  that aptly is put on .	0
yeah ,  while you’re alive ,  you’ll only draw your neck out of the hangman’s collar .	0
why ,  then ,  build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valor .	0
put on your nightgown .	0
my naked weapon is out.	0
i’ll see her like this .	0
i say ,  we will have no more marriages .	0
how does thy honor ?	0
dry sorrow drinks our blood .	0
don’t talk of him except as a property .	0
the dauphin really wants it to be morning .	0
i have seen thee fight when i have envied thy behavior .	0
damn them then ,  if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own !	0
i will make your peace with him if i can .	0
most sure and vulgar .	0
tis a fault to heaven, a fault against the dead, a fault to nature, to reason most absurd, whose common theme is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, from the first corse till he that died today, this must be so.	0
where have i been ?	0
therefore be doubledamn'd; swear thou art honest .	0
she hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste; for beauty, starv'd with her severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity.	0
you don’t see our hearts; they’re full of pity; pity the general injury of rome — as fire drives out fire ,  so pity drives out pity — has done this deed on caesar .	0
we should hold day with the direct opposite, if you would walk in absence of the sun.	0
this supernatural meeting can’t be bad, only it can’t be good either.	0
how died my master ,  strato ?	0
if you think about it correctly ,  caesar has suffered a great wrong .	0
i think he told me paris should have married juliet .	0
look how he laughs already !	0
now go find the forest ranger .	0
now let it work .	0
i do not think it good .	0
oh ,  let me kiss this princess hand of pure white ,  this seal of bliss !	0
o brave iago, honest and just, that hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!	0
no, for me now.	0
bloody, bawdy villain!	0
i warrant you ,  sir; the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver .	0
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us, but speak all good you can devise of caesar, and say you do't by our permission, else shall you not have any hand at all about his funeral.	0
as i am an honest man ,  i thought you had received some bodily wound .	0
behold and see .	0
bonos dies ,  sir toby .	0
look you ,  sir ,  such a one i was this present .	0
villain am i none .	0
to be thus is nothing, but to be safely thus.	0
indeed!	0
i could be sad .	0
you may deny me to be your friend; but i'll be your servant, whether you will want me or not.	0
you nimble lightnings ,  dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes !	0
there aren’t three people in all of egypt who could do better .	0
come ,  seek the conspirators .	0
you might have rhymed .	0
when you just want to eat ,  it’s better to do that at home .	0
i’ve told you what i intend to do ,  and i’ve sworn by the holy sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .	0
i don’t know you .	0
in my desperate situation ,  i have to act alone .	0
how now ,  roderigo !	0
then you would have to go beyond heaven ,  beyond earth .	0
draw your sword: one stroke shall free you from the taxes which you pay ,  and i the king shall be devoted to you .	0
just as i did with the meat ,  i’ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made ,  and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other ,  and the blanket over here and the sheets over there .	0
there’s five to one .	0
sir ,  i tell you that we are not .	0
thou dost conspire against thy friend ,  iago ,  if thou but think’st him wronged and mak’st his ear a stranger to thy thoughts .	0
come ,  you are too moral .	0
silenced with that ,  in viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day ,  he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks ,  nothing afeard of what thyself didst make ,  strange images of death .	0
do you know me ,  father ?	0
add thereto a tiger's chaudron, for the ingredients of our cauldron.	0
we’re in .	0
it waves me still.	0
when i came back— for this was brief —i found them close together ,  at blow and thrust ,  even as again they were when you yourself did part them .	0
o most pernicious woman !	0
come on, tell me the truth.	0
the sorrow that i have by right is yours ,  and all the pleasures you usurp are mine .	0
good.	0
why ,  too much freedom leads to woe .	0
don’t let him leave out the color of her hair .	0
oh ,  tranio ,  until it happened to me ,  i never would have thought it possible .	0
the devil’s advice is nicer .	0
my children too ?	0
what’s he ?	0
i thank it ,  poor fool ,  it keeps on the windy side of care .	0
i think he bought his shirt in italy, his hose in france, his hat in germany, and his behavior everywhere.	0
what’s that ?	0
read it ,  mark antony .	0
so if it pleases my lord ,  the duke ,  and all the court to set the fine for one half of his goods ,  i am content ,  as long as he will let me have the other half to use ,  to give it ,  on his death ,  to the gentleman that lately stole his daughter: two things more ,  that ,  for this favor ,  he presently becomes a christian; the other ,  that he records a gift ,  here in the court ,  of everything he has when he dies to his son ,  lorenzo ,  and his daughter .	0
i’ve had to acknowledge that he’s my son so many times that now i can do it without embarrassment .	0
you interpret my words in a melancholy sense ,  my hearty friends .	0
come here.	0
now my spirit is going .	0
i met this man with my glove in his cap ,  and i have been as good as my word .	0
turn back ,  dull earth ,  and find out where your center is .	0
tybalt is dead ,  and romeo has been banished .	0
did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?	0
where do you dwell ?	0
i don’t speak yet of proof.	0
nay ,  i can gleek upon occasion .	0
are you talking about caesar ?	0
shake off your sleepiness .	0
fairly spoke .	0
six o’clock, at which time, my lord, you said our work should end.	0
come on ,  be a man .	0
why so pale ,  my friend ?	0
aside] why speaks my father so urgently?	0
men act imprudently sometimes ,  then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .	0
what serious contemplation are you in ?	0
alexander ,  god knows and you know ,  in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations ,  and also being a little intoxicates in his prains ,  did ,  in his ales and his angers ,  look you ,  kill his best friend ,  cleitus .	0
yet ,  'tis the plague of great ones; prerogatived are they less than the base; 'tis destiny unshunnable ,  like death: even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken .	0
the man who was the baron still lives, only lives that life which he deserves to lose under the death penalty.	0
doth it ?	0
all hail, macbeth!	0
why ,  he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .	0
seafaring men, sir.	0
do but now promise ,  kate ,  you will endeavor for your french part of such a boy; and for my english moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor .	0
therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed: wash every mote out of his conscience .	0
i’ll do that ,  my lord .	0
we will hence forthwith to feast and sport us at thy father’s house .	0
what ,  mistress !	0
my countrymen— peace!	0
my father—i think i see my father .	0
hence !	0
i love you with so much of my heart that none is left to protest .	0
what can he say in this ?	0
o cassius ,  if you could only persuade the noble brutus to join us— don’t worry .	0
by'r lakin ,  a parlous fear .	0
i find thee apt; and duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed that roots itself in ease on lethe wharf, wouldst thou not stir in this.	0
away!	0
wilt thou slay thyself ?	0
madam ,  bethink you ,  like a careful mother ,  of the young prince your son .	0
this shall label our purpose as necessary and not jealous, which appearing to be respectful to common eyes, we shall be called purgers, not murderers.	0
be assured of this ,  that the magnifico is very popular; and has ,  in his office ,  a voice equal to twice the duke's .	0
you knew—no one knew ,  no one knew as well as you did—about my daughter’s plans to run away .	0
what were these ?	0
you are my true and honorable wife ,  as dear to me as are the ruddy drops that visit my sad heart .	0
i loved ophelia .	0
too early seen unknown, and known too late!	0
two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats will not debate the question of this straw .	0
my life is my foe's debt.	0
i don’t like her name .	0
the time to come .	0
it is a strange truth .	0
i think he’s nervous—he’s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .	0
please go to him ,  my friend .	0
he has both my power and my influence over octavia .	0
sweet ,  adieu !	0
there is only one mind in all these men, and it is bent against caesar.	0
i think ’twas soto that your honor means .	0
it is dangerous when the lower nature comes between the ups and downs of mighty opposites .	0
a calendar ,  a calendar !	0
with cassio ,  mistress .	0
let sorrow split my heart if ever i did hate thee or thy father .	0
he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in pyramus, or nothing.	0
romeo, will you come to your father's?	0
i’ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet—even more .	0
it’s well you offer it behind her back; the wish would other make a noisy house.	0
the swelling disease drown this fool !	0
double ,  double toil and trouble ,  fire burn and cauldron bubble .	0
i do entreat your grace to pardon me .	0
the clerk is answered .	0
sir, march is wasted fifteen days.	0
as i discern, it burneth in the capels’ monument.	0
leave me ,  iago .	0
i must to england; you know that?	0
if all the wine in my bottle will recover him ,  i will help his ague .	0
we will hear caesar's will .	0
did you call me ?	0
come shake hands with laertes ,  hamlet .	0
deal ?	0
but look to it: find out thy brother ,  wheresoe'er he is .	0
what country ,  friends ,  is this ?	0
must i endure all this ?	0
wasn’t that letter from beautiful jessica?	0
what garment would your honor like to wear today ?	0
i could never better stead thee than now .	0
and you shall speak after my speech is ended on the same platform where i’m going to be .	0
when caesar says ,   " do this ,  "  i do it .	0
where is he ?	0
tell them that you know that hero loves me .	0
yes ,  for your own safety ,  you should deny one thing: you have been a great thief at sea .	0
emilia ,  come .	0
banquo and macbeth ,  all hail !	0
nay ,  guiltiness will speak ,  though tongues were out of use .	0
oh ,  my liege ,  my wife died tonight .	0
listen to me: you shall not go.	0
very well ,  thank you .	0
you are as good as a chorus, my lord.	0
give me your hand .	0
let go !	0
all offices are open ,  and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven .	0
no, let me not.	0
and so doth mine .	0
shall i go fetch your nightgown ?	0
ever since i’ve been a free agent in my choice of friends ,  i’ve chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance ,  grateful for both good and bad .	0
i don’t know what i shall think of that; but i am launcelot ,  the jew's man ,  and i am sure margery your wife is my mother .	0
but indeed, sir, we make holiday, to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.	0
who comes here ?	0
we have sworn ,  my lord ,  already .	0
approach thou like the rugged russian bear ,  the armed rhinoceros ,  or th' hyrcan tiger; take any shape but that ,  and my firm nerves shall never tremble .	0
not one ,  my lord .	0
he will not say so .	0
it is a wise father that knows his own child .	0
he never gave commandment for their death .	0
mercutio, thou consortest with romeo.	0
hippolyta, i woo'd thee with my sword, and won thy love doing thee injuries; but i will wed thee in another key, with pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.	0
that was my turquoise ring !	0
by the eighth hour.	0
disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread !	0
choose your revenge .	0
marry ,  we were sent for to the justices .	0
self - love ,  my liege ,  is not so great a sin as self - neglect .	0
i would your grace would constrain me to tell .	0
my lord ,  this bill that’s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old king henry’s reign .	0
but the rarity of it is—which is indeed almost beyond credit—  as many vouched rarities are .	0
i pray thee ,  understand a plain man in his plain meaning; go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table ,  serve in the meat ,  and we will come in to dinner .	0
what ring did you give, my lord?	0
this was a merry message .	0
he may command me as my sovereign ,  but you have power in me as in a kinsman .	0
when it is lit ,  come back and call me here .	0
well ,  that one ,  i think ,  is young petruchio .	0
come, my dear love, the purchase made, the fruits are to follow, that profit is still to come between me and you.	0
then i’ll really give it to you .	0
oh ,  on my soul ,  my cousin is belied !	0
if he looks serious ,  he must need money .	0
almost the middle of the night .	0
oh ,  my lord ,  when wisdom and passion are in one body ,  it’s ten to one that the passion will win .	0
these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself have banish'd me from scotland .	0
ay, marry, why was he sent into england?	0
let's withdraw, my lord.	0
yet but three ?	0
and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us .	0
never hamlet.	0
tell me what you are .	0
so i’d like it copied .	0
i scolded you for obsessing about her ,  not for loving her ,  my student .	0
what, is he dead?	0
antonio shall be obligated; right?	0
cassio !	0
first ,  he said you had no right to him .	0
the sight of them is offensive .	0
what time is it ?	0
o gertrude ,  let’s go !	0
irreparable is the loss, and patience says it is past her cure.	0
friend, look to it.	0
with lysander?	0
the sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, but that the sea, mounting to th’ welkin's cheek, dashes the fire out.	0
yes, my lord, just as long as you don’t ask me to forget about it.	0
an if your wife be not a mad woman ,  and know how well i have deserv'd the ring ,  she would not hold out enemy for ever ,  for giving it to me .	0
what’s your name ,  please ,  friend ?	0
day ,  night ,  hour ,  tide ,  time ,  work ,  play ,  alone ,  in company ,  still my care hath been to have her matched .	0
o ,  my daughter !	0
i did give the finger, sir.	0
when he came to again ,  he said ,  if he had done or said anything out of order ,  he wanted the people to think it was his infirmity .	0
you think so ?	0
ah ,  he got you back ,  benedick !	0
orlando sends his regards to you both ,  and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls  “ his rosalind .  ”  is that you ?	0
goodbye .	0
o mischief, thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men!	0
and, after that he came, away sad?	0
i’m not stephano ,  i’m a walking cramp .	0
o, horrible!	0
farewell .	0
when 'twas a little prating thing—o, there is a nobleman in town, one paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him.	0
the excuse that you make in this delay is longer than the tale you excuse .	0
o woeful day !	0
god be at your table !	0
ay ,  or drinking ,  fencing ,  swearing ,  quarreling ,  drabbing—you may go so far .	0
what ,  man ?	0
if she find him not ,  to england send him or confine him where your wisdom best shall think .	0
my lord ,  you know i love you .	0
alas the day!	0
my gorge rises at it .	0
why ,  so i can ,  sir ,  but i will not now .	0
well, honor is the subject of my story.	0
your servants ever have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt, to make their audit at your highness’ pleasure, still to return your own.	0
he only lived but till he was a man ,  the which no sooner had his prowess confirmed in the unshrinking station where he fought ,  but like a man he died .	0
i don’t think there is any such woman .	0
why do you cry?	0
in addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for a long time ,  the reason we need to see you made us send our hasty invitation .	0
so that, dear lords, if i be left behind, a moth of peace, and he go to the war, the rites for which i love him are bereft me, and i a heavy interim shall support by his dear absence.	0
what counterfeit did i give you?	0
but i will acquaint my daughter withal ,  that she may be the better prepared for an answer if peradventure this be true .	0
motley’s the only wear .	0
sir ,  you need a drink .	0
but i yield to die .	0
not if the minor ones come up first .	0
juno and ceres are whispering about something serious .	0
who is this maiden with whom you were at play?	0
yet brutus says he was ambitious ,  and brutus is an honorable man .	0
it’s out already !	0
it’s worse than murder to humiliate a king’s messenger like this .	0
with all my heart ,  so thou canst get a wife .	0
not very well ,  but i’ve met him several times .	0
at home ,  my lord .	0
i’ll get you for that .	0
but that a joy past joy calls out on me, it were a grief so brief to part with thee.	0
alas ,  good cassio !	0
shall no man else be touch'd but only caesar?	0
no ,  my good lord .	0
not possible .	0
where the devil should he learn our language ?	0
is he not able to discharge the money ?	0
we have to give up and let him go .	0
after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.	0
the jewels you have had from me to deliver to desdemona would half have corrupted a nun.	0
i’m not interested in anything a eunuch can do .	0
is it in the air or the earth ?	0
my gracious sovereign ,  now in devonshire ,  as i by friends am well advertisèd ,  sir edward courtney and the haughty prelate ,  bishop of exeter ,  his elder brother ,  with many more confederates are in arms .	0
come ,  come ,  you answer me stupidly .	0
then stand with us .	0
where are these lads?	0
you were never with me for anything when you were not there for the goose.	0
good morrow ,  my good lords .	0
won’t you wait a minute?	0
these crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit ,  but who cares ?	0
for ,  as i am a soldier ,  the name i think suits me best ,  once i begin my attack on harfleur again ,  i will not leave the half - conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes .	0
i will hear further reason for this .	0
you’re my lieutenant now .	0
ah ,  poor ghost !	0
to bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate.	0
spirits, which by mine art i have from their confines call'd to enact my present fancies.	0
alas the day !	0
here’s another ,  stronger than the first .	0
another thing ,  domitius: antony wants to see you now .	0
oh ,  pardon me ,  signior gremio ,  i would fain be doing .	0
leave you!	0
he was crazy to run away .	0
well ,  that’s what the wife brings to the marriage .	0
i'll mark the play.	0
but if you decide not to marry me ,  you’ll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?	0
why ,  it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes ,  and the clerestories toward the south - north are as lustrous as ebony .	0
i'll bet fourteen of my teeth ,  and yet ,  to tell the truth ,  i’ve only got four ,  she is not fourteen .	0
do they hold the same respect they did when i was in the city?	0
and don’t say all of that yet .	0
you have taken it more seriously than i meant you to.	0
how, how, how, how, choplogic?	0
caesar’s sister is called octavia .	0
look, look!	0
your voice shall be as strong as any man's in giving out the new honorable offices.	0
speak .	0
or else it stood upon the choice of friends— o hell ,  to choose love by another’s eyes !	0
o, overcome them with zeal.	0
it was two ere i left him ,  and now the clock strikes one .	0
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing .	0
jailer, look to him.	0
what less than the end of the world is the prince's sentence ?	0
tis for the head.	0
who has put in?	0
i do ,  mark antony .	0
then this was an island—except for the son that she had here, a freckled pup, born of a witch—not resembling any human shape.	0
oh fates!	0
i am sorry that your leisure serves you not .	0
i bet she’s fast asleep .	0
go one, and call the jew into the court.	0
why doth it not then our eyelids sink?	0
but let the frame of things disjoint ,  both the worlds suffer ,  ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly .	0
this is some token from a newer friend.	0
what ladybird !	0
but i will wed thee in another key ,  with pomp ,  with triumph ,  and with reveling .	0
pluck off colorful butterfly wings ,  and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .	0
two hundred ducats .	0
my lord and brother ,  god save you .	0
be a careful mother ,  madam ,  and think about your son ,  the young prince .	0
one .	0
in the meantime ,  please think i am too occupied with my fears ,  as there are strong reasons to fear i am ,  and consider her innocent ,  i beg your honor .	0
his counselors will govern as long as he’s a minor ,  and then he’ll take over .	0
they’re wise and honorable ,  and will no doubt give you reasons for it .	0
no wonder ,  sir ,  but certainly a maid .	0
we must be married ,  or we must live in bawdry . —farewell ,  good master oliver ,  not               'tis no matter .	0
now, my dear lady, by most strange accident, generous luck, has brought my enemies to this shore; and by my knowledge of things to come, i find my highest point depends on a very lucky star, that, if i don’t seek its influence now and overlook it, my fortunes will sink forever after.	0
frailty ,  thy name is woman— a little month ,  or ere those shoes were old with which she follow'd my poor father's body like niobe ,  all tears—why she ,  even she— o god !	0
leave me ,  friends .	0
it shall penetrate your understanding that i am innocent of your father's death, and am most sincerely in grief for it, as day penetrates your eye.	0
the loss cannot be repaid ,  and patience says it is beyond her cure .	0
sweet portia ,  if you knew to whom i gave the ring ,  if you knew for whom i gave the ring ,  and would think about for what i gave the ring ,  and how unwillingly i let the ring go ,  when nothing would be accepted but the ring ,  you would decrease the strength of your anger .	0
romeo he cries aloud ,  ‘hold ,  friends !	0
who hath he left behind him general ?	0
ay, my lord.	0
my lord ,  he will swear on his life that i haven’t kept a thing . —tell the truth ,  seleucus .	0
what hempen home-spuns have we swagg'ring here, so near the cradle of the fairy queen?	0
to divert your attention ,  why do you go about trying to figure me out ,  as if you’re to pick a fight ?	0
upon my life, lamord.	0
i cannot wish the fault undone ,  the issue of it being so proper .	0
away with it !	0
am i not stay'd for?	0
i'll teach you how to flow.	0
the fish lives in the sea ,  and 'tis much pride for fair without the fair within to hide .	0
to cut his throat in the church .	0
please ,  corporal ,  stop !	0
happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child .	0
first ,  forward to the temple; after dinner your hazard shall be made .	0
but for all this thou shalt have as many dolors for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year .	0
the all - seeing sun ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .	0
there is no vice so simple, but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts.	0
my leg is cut in two .	0
inquire the jew's house out, give him this deed, and let him sign it; we'll away to-night, and be a day before our husbands home.	0
i'll charm the air to give a sound ,  while you perform your antic round ,  that this great king may kindly say our duties did his welcome pay .	0
what's this?	0
he that stirs next to carve for his own rage holds his soul light ,  he dies upon his motion .	0
a thousand thousand !	0
ay, my good lord.	0
tell him there's a letter arrived from my master with his horn full of good news; my master will be here before morning.	0
they pray; grant thou ,  lest faith turn to despair .	0
i can’t believe that dog ,  that rat ,  that mouse ,  that cat could scratch me to death !	0
i am satisfied in nature, whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge.	0
caesar sits down in alexandria ,  where i will oppose his fate .	0
i have done nothing but in care of thee ,  of thee ,  my dear one ,  thee ,  my daughter ,  who art ignorant of what thou art ,  naught knowing of whence i am ,  nor that i am more better than prospero ,  master of a full poor cell ,  and thy no greater father .	0
be not so long to speak.	0
oh ,  i am out of breath in this happy chase !	0
my noble partner you greet with present grace and great prediction of noble having and of royal hope ,  that he seems rapt withal .	0
here i go .	0
first, forward to the temple: after dinner your choice shall be made.	0
and now this man has become a god ,  and cassius is a wretched creature ,  and must bow ,  even if caesar only nods at him carelessly .	0
well ,  well; but ,  as for me ,  as i have made up my mind to run away ,  so i’ll not rest until i have run some ground .	0
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth ,  unfit for toil and trouble in the world ,  if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts ?	0
take not her part .	0
is't possible ?	0
fed with the same food ,  hurt with the same weapons ,  subject to the same diseases ,  healed by the same means ,  warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a christian is ?	0
well ,  sir ,  it’s true it came soon after .	0
besides ,  i don’t like you .	0
let it not, brutus.	0
what ,  up and down ,  carved like an apple tart ?	0
a man who can tell the future is telling you to beware march 15 .	0
lord ,  what fools these mortals are !	0
as the indifferent children of the earth .	0
well ,  okay . —i swear to god ,  both their stories match .	0
how did you divide yourself in two ?	0
not in a grave to lay one in, and take another out.	0
what now, sweet queen!	0
in what, my dear lord?	0
the person who’s poor and contented is rich enough .	0
dost fall ?	0
why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?	0
now ,  tailor ,  let’s see what you’ve got .	0
your lady ,  sir ,  your lady .	0
good - night; and better health attend his majesty !	0
if i can catch him once at a disadvantage, i’ll feed the ancient grudge i bear him until it’s fat.	0
you are welcome .	0
come ,  my lord; and in our flight ,  tell me how it came this night that i sleeping here was found with these mortals on the ground .	0
no, in despite of sense and secrecy, unpeg the basket on the house's top, let the birds fly, and like the famous ape, to try conclusions, in the basket creep and break your own neck down.	0
you must not ,  sir ,  mistake my niece .	0
in happy time .	0
what wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst praise me?	0
over thy wounds now do i prophesy— which ,  like dumb mouths ,  do ope their ruby lips to beg the voice and utterance of my tongue— a curse shall light upon the limbs of men .	0
his speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all disordered.	0
big mars seems bankrupt in their beggared host and faintly through a rusty beaver peeps .	0
i know you .	0
bless you ,  beautiful dame !	0
o ,  that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused !	0
pish !	0
you worthless girl !	0
and we did think it writ down in our duty to let you know of it .	0
in sooth ,  i know not why i am so sad; it wearies me; you say it wearies you; but how i caught it ,  found it ,  or came by it ,  what stuff 'tis made of ,  whereof it is born ,  i am to learn; and such a want - wit sadness makes of me ,  that i have much ado to know myself .	0
i’ll not budge an inch ,  boy .	0
since it’s drizzling ,  stand under this overhang with me and ,  like a true drunk ,  i’ll tell you everything .	0
he is far gone, far gone!	0
you come most carefully upon your hour .	0
did you ne'er hear say, two may keep counsel, putting one away?	0
tonight ,  my lord ?	0
i’ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .	0
why ,  the one that the moor first gave to desdemona; the one that you asked me so often to steal .	0
i have it !	0
fine apparition !	0
o setebos, these are brave spirits indeed.	0
the very head and front of my offending hath this extent ,  no more .	0
take you me for a sponge ,  my lord ?	0
good running ,  thisbe !	0
up ,  sword ,  and know a more horrid intention .	0
but if these events, as i’m sure they do, bear fire enough to kindle cowards, and to harden the melting spirits of women with valor, then, countrymen, what do we need any other motivation except our own causeto prod us to revenge?	0
here comes one o' the parings .	0
by what rule ,  sir ?	0
no ,  ’tis hereafter to know ,  but now to promise .	0
the eye of man hath not heard ,  the ear of man hath not seen ,  man's hand is not able to taste ,  his tongue to conceive ,  nor his heart to report ,  what my dream was .	0
where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord, we cannot get from him.	0
i dreamt tonight that i feasted with caesar, and unlucky things directed my imagination.	0
the black rooster, so black of hue, with orange-tawny bill, the thrush with his note so true, the wren with little quill.	0
lady ,  you come hither to be married to this count ?	0
treat them with honor and dignity .	0
on the platform ,  between eleven and twelve ,  i’ll visit you .	0
what will you do with't, that you have been so earnest to have me filch it?	0
i hope my noble lord esteems me honest.	0
no more of that.	0
you !	0
whither away ?	0
it was me ,  no one else .	0
supper is done ,  and we shall come too late .	0
i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother: good wombs have borne bad sons.	0
is your other mouth calling my name ?	0
noting this poverty ,  i said to myself ,   ” if a man did need a poison now ,   ” the sale of which is punished by death in mantua ,   ” here lives a poor wretch would sell it to him .  ”  o ,  this same thought only predicted my need ,  and this same needy man must sell it to me .	0
good sir ,  this ring was given me by my wife .	0
trinculo ,  if you trouble him any more in's tale ,  by this hand ,  i will supplant some of your teeth .	0
honestly ,  no .	0
don’t be afraid of what i think .	0
romeo will answer it .	0
nay, heaven doth know.	0
i am very sorry that you are not well .	0
what’s the matter ?	0
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?	0
myself have letters of the selfsame tenure .	0
banquo !	0
be silent .	0
why, look you there!	0
thank you so much .	0
i did not think ,  sir ,  to have met you here .	0
i don’t think so .	0
did heaven look on ,  and would not take their part ?	0
come, swear it, damn yourself; lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves should fear to seize you.	0
nothing that is so is so .	0
here is a sick man that would speak with you.	0
out ,  you bag of garbage !	0
gentlemen ,  can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo ?	0
well ,  there you go .	0
since this fortune falls to you, be content and seek no other new one.	0
this madman will murder me .	0
sir ,  i will answer anything .	0
i'll play this bout first; set it by awhile .	0
is it so ?	0
the robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; he robs himself that spends a bootless grief .	0
it’s mine and i’m going to get it .	0
what do you say ,  your highness ,  about my just request ?	0
a piece of work that will make sick men well again.	0
nay ,  faith ,  let not me play a woman; i have a beard coming .	0
i beg you ,  see there !	0
so guildenstern and rosencrantz go to't.	0
o ,  what a great thing learning is !	0
what thou wouldst do is done unto thy hand .	0
what would my potent master ?	0
i don’t know where he lives; and for me to make up a lodging ,  and say he lies here or he lies there is to lie in my own throat .	0
yes ,  just like this .	0
if you be well pleas'd with this, and hold your fortune for your bliss, turn you where your lady is, and claim her with a loving kiss.	0
i beseech you ,  let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation; for i never knew so young a body with so old a head .	0
let that be left which leaves itself .	0
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead (strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think !	0
or be alive again, and dare me to the desert with thy sword.	0
go back ,  slave ,  or i’ll knock you one across the head .	0
if you’d been as wise as you were bold ,  with an old man’s mature judgment ,  you wouldn’t have had to read this scroll .	0
these are gracious drops.	0
well, let him go.	0
if that this simple syllogism will serve ,  so .	0
in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maiden's eyes: besides ,  the lottery of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing: but ,  if my father had not scanted me ,  and hedg'd me by his wit ,  to yield myself his wife ,  who wins me by that means i told you ,  yourself ,  renowned prince ,  then stood as fair as any comer i have look'd on yet ,  for my affection .	0
tell me, just to be sure, even though i'll swear that i know your voice.	0
but goodbye; i have some business to see to.	0
myself ,  he ,  and my sister today did dine together .	0
but is he often like this ?	0
all my pretty ones ?	0
that ,  my best friend ,  might still inflame you with passion for the crown ,  in addition to the title of the baron of cawdor .	0
since you are a lying hypocrite ,  we must look after you .	0
was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?	0
for that you must but say i could not help it .	0
i won’t leave him alone until he gives cassio his job back . —how are you ,  my lord ?	0
ay ,  but not yet to die .	0
but you wouldn’t know what a bad feeling i have inside .	0
come ,  romeo .	0
i’ll work on this ,  because i can give his state of mind true purpose ,  and i’ll bring him to the capitol .	0
a spiteful ,  self - willed ,  badly behaved child ,  she is .	0
brutus is wise ,  and were he not in health ,  he would embrace the means to come by it .	0
what, are you crazy?	0
i won’t any hooked instruments.	0
i never gave him cause .	0
farewell ,  dear father .	0
that same cowardly giant-like ox-beef hath devoured many a gentleman of your house.	0
what will this do ?	0
are you sure of that ?	0
don’t you have a letter for me from the friar ?	0
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline.	0
even in hell you couldn’t find a devil worse than macbeth .	0
actually ,  it’s not so unusual when you think about it .	0
he’ll speak with you ,  will you or no .	0
who's there ?	0
i see you don’t intend to part with her—or perhaps you don’t like my company .	0
have you heard the argument?	0
it is ,  my lord .	0
for this drivelling love is like a great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.	0
god save you ,  sir !	0
the woman falls; surely, he has killed his wife.	0
hark!	0
from top to toe?	0
we have lost best half of our affair.	0
did he say it?	0
my spirits ,  as in a dream ,  are all bound up .	0
what unusual reason brings her here?	0
she’s no longer my daughter ,  and i’ll never see her face again .	0
pray you avoid it.	0
he will find it comes from a clodpole .	0
well ,  i will walk myself over to count paris’ house ,  to prepare him for tomorrow .	0
my mother is waiting.	0
i have been talking with a petitioner here ,  a man that suffers greatly in your displeasure .	0
what do you mean?	0
old lord, i can’t blame you.	0
did you talk with this woman ?	0
what find i here?	0
no .	0
well ,  my good lord ,  i’ll do ’t .	0
my life were better ended by their hate than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	0
your part in her you could not keep from death ,  but heaven keeps his part in eternal life .	0
tomorrow dinner ,  then ?	0
yes ,  i’ll say it again ,  my lord .	0
go play with yourself .	0
don’t you know that i’m a woman ?	0
the soldier’s pole is fall’n !	0
your master and his servant are here .	0
what if she’s pretty but stupid ?	0
trebonius knows his time .	0
i know not ,  lady .	0
well too.	0
give me your hand first .	0
these our actors, as i foretold you, were all spirits, and are melted into air, into thin air; and, like the baseless fabric of this vision, the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself, yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, and, like this insubstantial pageant faded, leave not a rack behind.	0
you’ll live in luxury with gremio .	0
aside .	0
gentlemen all , —alas ,  what shall i say ?	0
yet ’tis the plague to great ones ,  prerogatived are they less than the base .	0
let him go ,  gertrude .	0
i could marry this wench for this device .	0
and they respond to you with their hearts as well .	0
that’s the way great men ought to endure great losses .	0
be invisible to everyone except yourself and me .	0
the women you rape are the ones who’ll have to  “ sense ”  it .	0
i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life .	0
you lie about her, and you are a devil.	0
some should go to the public platforms and cry out ,   “ liberty ,  freedom ,  and democracy !  ”  people and senators ,  don’t be afraid .	0
that’s where i’m going now ,  so i’ll leave you here .	0
please ,  do so .	0
i don’t like your faults.	0
i would the lightning had burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile !	0
affliction is in love of your parts ,  and you are married to calamity .	0
is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?	0
his very opinion in the letter !	0
the time is out of joint .	0
what did you say ?	0
helena, it’s not true.	0
this will put them out of fear.	0
alas ,  you don’t know .	0
juno sings her blessings upon you .	0
i believe we must leave the killing out, when all is said and done.	0
to tell you the truth ,  they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition .	0
but ,  as i said ,  in the middle of july ,  she’ll be fourteen; that she will ,  by mary; i remember it well .	0
then make a circle around the corpse of caesar, and let me show you the man who made the will.	0
though our lives — your spirits shine through you .	0
but ,  o vain boast !	0
what should i do with him ?	0
wake when some vile thing is near .	0
an if they live ,  i hope i need not fear .	0
a most extracting frenzy of mine own from my remembrance clearly banished his .	0
they’re really being spoken ,  sir ,  and they’re true .	0
ok .  go ahead .	0
caesar is upset .	0
quick ,  quick !	0
blistered be thy tongue for such a wish !	0
sit down awhile, and let us once again assail your ears, that are so fortified against our story, what we two nights have seen.	0
to a nunnery, go; and quickly too.	0
wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	0
lord ,  how it looks about !	0
romeo cried out ,   “ stop ,  my friends .	0
what do i see on you?	0
demetrius ,  i will keep my word with you .	0
why did you bring these daggers from the place ?	0
out of doubt he is transported .	0
we won’t take their garbage .	0
were't good ?	0
have you conspired, have you contrived with these men to bait me with this disgusting insult?	0
but ,  as you say ,  sir ,  let your bounty take a nap ,  i will awake it anon .	0
what call you the carriages ?	0
what man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night, so stumblest on my counsel?	0
i beseech you, let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation; for i never knew so young a body with so old a head.	0
come ,  some music !	0
i’ll write to my sister and tell her my plans .	0
ay, sir.	0
solemn music] [solemn music] [to alonso] a solemn air ,  and the best comforter [to alonso] a solemn to an unsettled fancy ,  cure thy brains ,  now useless ,  boiled within thy skull .	0
why ,  would that have fixed my hair ?	0
i am dead ,  horatio .	0
away with us to athens .	0
i’m finished ,  then .	0
wilt thou destroy him then ?	0
a simple countryman that brought her figs .	0
if he said that ,  then i hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .	0
but it’s dark out ,  and it could be a trap .	0
o excellent young man!	0
how oddly he is dressed !	0
thus have i ,  wall ,  my part discharged so; and ,  being done ,  thus wall away doth go .	0
what's the matter ?	0
desire him to go in .	0
i’m afraid you’ll come to me again for ransom .	0
your wife and babies savagely slaughtered .	0
what will you do for her?	0
ay ,  let her rot and perish and be damned tonight ,  for she shall not live .	0
do you in conscience think ,  tell me ,  emilia ,  that there are women who abuse their husbands in such a disgusting way ?	0
that's certain, if the devil may be her judge.	0
i will play the swan, and die in music.	0
and yet it is almost against my conscience.	0
let me come to her .	0
poor desdemon!	0
and i have heard apollodorus carried—                                                                               what ,  i pray you ?	0
marvelous sweet music!	0
here’s a good world the while .	0
silence!	0
but now ,  my lord ,  what say you to my suit ?	0
o son, the night before thy wedding day hath death lain with thy wife.	0
i could do without another toast .	0
your man and you are marvelous merry ,  sir .	0
it will be rain tonight .	0
but truly ,  if i were as	0
on the ground!	0
prithee ,  emilia ,  go know of cassio where he supp'd tonight .	0
i know that virtue to be in you, brutus, as well as i do know your outward favor.	0
widow dido ,  ”  you said ?	0
tell antony brutus is ta'en .	0
come ,  come with me ,  and we will make short work; for ,  by your leaves ,  you shall not stay alone till holy church incorporate two in one .	0
i take't ’tis later ,  sir .	0
and nothing in your letters was written about her ?	0
speak ,  is it out o' the way ?	0
his ships are maneuverable .	0
come ,  go ,  good juliet .	0
i wish the night were here already !	0
the people knows it ,  and have now received his accusations .	0
oh nature ,  what were you doing in hell ?	0
for your coming in to dinner ,  sir ,  why ,  let it be as humours and conceits shall govern .	0
o love !	0
news, friends; our wars are done, the turks are drowned.	0
but to be frank ,  and give it thee again .	0
you lie ,  you disgusting tyrant .	0
my old bones ache .	0
i was told that by one who knows him better than you .	0
i look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.	0
help ,  ho !	0
look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff’s deputy .	0
is he alone ?	0
the queen drinks to your good luck and happiness ,  hamlet .	0
let thunder rumble !	0
stay ,  you imperfect speakers ,  tell me more .	0
fool!	0
hark!	0
the dearest friend to me, the kindest man, the best-condition'd and unwearied spirit in doing courtesies; and one in whom the ancient roman honour more appears, than any that draws breath in italy.	0
preference goes by who you know and who likes you ,  and not by old system ,  where each second person took the first’s place .	0
is the king awake yet ,  worthy baron ?	0
but it is certain i am loved of all ladies ,  only you excepted .	0
she awakes.	0
a visor for a visor!	0
out of doubt he is transported.	0
so much was his pleasure should be proclaimed .	0
let me go with him .	0
what is it, my lord?	0
yes, and wisely.	0
i’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .	0
come ,  madam ,  let’s leave .	0
full half an hour .	0
i’ll have him away tonight .	0
farewell .	0
they’re calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .	0
no, as i shall be saved.	0
lysander's love, that would not let him wait,— fair helena,—who makes the night more golden than all the fiery rays and eyes of light.	0
why ,  know'st thou any harm's intended towards him ?	0
what are you, that seizes this time of night, taking the same fair and warlike form in which the dead king of denmark, now buried, did sometimes march?	0
i’ll tear her all to pieces !	0
a countenance more in sorrow than in anger.	0
my strange self - delusions just come from inexperience .	0
it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong .	0
you see, her eyes are open.	0
what say you, james soundpost?	0
no ,  by my life and soul !	0
and when please you to say so ?	0
no matter.	0
but if you die before i return ,  you’ll have made a mockery of my efforts .	0
we’ve got some words of wisdom to mull over .	0
there is no way but this ,  sir andrew .	0
you know ,  antonio ,  how much i have wasted my money by putting on a fancier appearance than my small funds could support; i don’t come to you now to ask that you forgive my debts ,  because my chief concern is to make good on these great debts which my behavior ,  sometimes reckless and wasteful ,  has left me broke .	0
why, friends, you go ahead to do you don’t know what.	0
true; except the means to live it.	0
will you come?	0
a whoreson, mad fellow's it was.	0
cure her of that.	0
into god’s hands .	0
then must the jew be merciful.	0
why ,  one that swears and lies .	0
o thou dull moor !	0
those are her orders .	0
shall i be married ,  then ,  tomorrow morning ?	0
i'll go around and drive the low people away from the streets; you do this too ,  where you see many of them gathered together .	0
oh ,  i have read it .	0
my lord ,  i have .	0
how are they escoted ?	0
den it sall also content me .	0
let’s slash their backs and grab ’em like we do rabbits ,  from behind .	0
it was a vision fair and fortunate .	0
i'll follow you; i'll lead you about a round ,  through bog ,  through bush ,  through brake ,  through brier; sometime a horse i'll be ,  sometime a hound ,  a hog ,  a headless bear ,  sometime a fire; and neigh ,  and bark ,  and grunt ,  and roar ,  and burn ,  like horse ,  hound ,  hog ,  bear ,  fire ,  at every turn .	0
he will come straight .	0
what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities?	0
you need not fear ,  lady ,  the having any of these lords: they have acquainted me with their determinations: which is ,  indeed ,  to return to their home ,  and to trouble you with no more suit; unless you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposition ,  depending on the caskets .	0
my lord !	0
and cries aloud ,   “ tarry ,  my cousin suffolk .	0
oh ,  i’m dead !	0
not one, my lord.	0
whoo - hoo !	0
i pray you give me leave.	0
the galleys have sent a dozen sequential messengers this very night at one another's heels; and many of the consuls, awakened and meeting, are at the duke's already.	0
signior brabantio ,  ho !	0
throw her out ,  the good for nothing !	0
murder !	0
o, what a beast was i to scold him!	0
precious villain !	0
you don’t need it yet .	0
and, i beg you, twist the law once to your authority; to do a great right, do a little wrong, and deprive this cruel devil of his will.	0
but age with his stealing steps hath clawed me in his clutch, and hath shipped me intil the land, as if i had never been such.	0
i do believe ’twas he .	0
you can order no more than she can beg; your threats have no more strength than her weak prayers . — helena ,  i love you; by my life i do; i swear ,  by that which i will lose for you ,  to prove him a liar that says i don’t love you .	0
all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; i ,  the man in the moon; this thornbush ,  my thornbush; and this dog ,  my dog .	0
ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen ,  i would change my humanity with a baboon .	0
it warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .	0
hath not a jew hands ,  organs ,  dimensions ,  senses ,  affections ,  passions ?	0
yare !	0
what ,  ho !	0
sir ,  octavius has already arrived in rome .	0
no ,  who are  long live the king !	0
then would to god that i had never seen't !	0
at least i’m sure it may be so in denmark .	0
but, good lieutenant, is your general wived?	0
here ,  take my sword .	0
you’re going to rest while you’re still damned ?	0
he had a fever when he was in spain ,  and when the fit was on him ,  i did mark how he did shake .	0
i’ll do the best i can ,  my lord .	0
what are you thinking ?	0
but, as we often see a silence in the heavens, after some storm, the gales stand still, the bold winds speechless, and the earth below as hushed as death, and eventually the dreadful thunder tears the region, so, after pyrrhus' pause, a roused anger renews him and he begins to work, and never did the one-eyed monster’s hammers fall on the god of war’s amour, forged for eternal strength, with less sorrow than pyrrhus' bleeding sword now falls on priam.	0
just one glass .	0
i think belman is just as good ,  my lord .	0
excellent in fencing ,  i mean ,  sir .	0
they do me wrong ,  and i will not endure it !	0
please ,  write down  “ borachio .  ” —and yours ?	0
my lord!	0
upon the stroke of four .	0
lady, shall i lie in your lap?	0
i don’t know, madam.	0
a husband ?	0
swallows have built in cleopatra’s sails their nests .	0
holy franciscan friar, brother, ho!	0
i pray thee, tell me then that he is well.	0
it’s almost ten o'clock .	0
well ,  good luck !	0
well, then i shall see thee again?	0
tarry, rash wanton; am not i thy lord?	0
swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither.	0
a bloody deed!	0
this is a majestic and harmonious vision .	0
you do stay ,  please ,  tell me what you think of me .	0
if thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, i spurn thee like a cur out of my way.	0
shylock ,  there's three times your money offered to you .	0
hamlet, you are killed, no medicine in the world can save you.	0
yes, lady, that’s what i said.	0
if you would conjure in her ,  you must make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true likeness ,  he must appear naked and blind .	0
it is your music, madam, from the house.	0
as the time, the place, and the condition of this country stands, i could heartily wish this had not happen, but since it is what it is, fix it for your own good.	0
madam ,  not yet .	0
go get some water, and wash this filthy witness from your hands.	0
alas, he's crazy!	0
this fellow i remember since once he played a farmer’s eldest son .	0
he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows not the stop.	0
a great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching!	0
i met the youthful lord at laurence’ cell and gave him what becomed love i might, not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.	0
my lord, from head to foot.	0
every man look o'er his part .	0
i’ll do so .	0
she has spoke what she should not ,  i am sure of that .	0
what did you say ,  uncle ?	0
we will mingle with these people, and play the humble host.	0
i’m sure i’ll never get married in the way my sisters say they’re married ,  loving their father only .	0
why ,  sir ,  give the gods a thankful sacrifice .	0
that’s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .	0
why did i get married?	0
i don’t cross you, but i will.	0
i’m not telling a lie .	0
use desdemona well .	0
who can be wise ,  amazed ,  temperate ,  and furious ,  loyal and neutral ,  in a moment ?	0
what art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw ?	0
my lord ?	0
no more about drowning, do you hear?	0
live a thousand years ,  i shall not find myself so apt to die .	0
come ,  let’s go to the king .	0
why did you laugh then ,  when i said man delights not me ?	0
lo thee !	0
i loved one speech in particular .	0
a very handsome man .	0
what ,  girl ,  though gray do something mingle with our younger brown ,  yet ha’ we a brain that nourishes our nerves and can get goal for goal of youth .	0
sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.	0
stand !	0
most rightful judge!	0
don’t .	0
leave me ,  my friend .	0
let’s see here .	0
what man dost thou dig it for ?	0
only ,  for all this ,  when i shall tread upon the tyrant's head ,  or wear it on my sword ,  my poor country shall still have more vices than it had before ,  more suffer ,  and in more ways than ever before ,  by the man who shall succeed the king .	0
but this is most falliable ,  the worm’s an odd worm .	0
your case, dear friend, shall be my authority for what i do: as you go to milan, i'll come by naples.	0
good point ,  and well said .	0
how art thou out of breath when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ?	0
stand together solidly ,  for fear that some friend of caesar's should happen — don’t talk about standing . —publius ,  good cheer !	0
go take this shape and hither come in ’t .	0
come on ,  you can be as angry as any guy in italy when you’re in the mood .	0
difficult to question, but, when we ask for something, he is most free in his reply.	0
on the way ,  we came across my wife ,  her sister ,  and their gang of vile associates .	0
where be thy tenants and thy followers ?	0
and i see her also through the eyes of love .	0
good morrow ,  noble sir .	0
oh ,  if it turns out to be true that he survived ,  then that storm was kind ,  and the ocean was full of love !	0
do they seem religious ?	0
it will be hard if  “ cambio ”  loses her .	0
make room ,  and let him stand before our face .	0
your descendants will be kings ,  even though you will not be one .	0
where dost thou hide thy head ?	0
make that good .	0
don’t you letters to me from the friar?	0
to my sick soul ,  as sin's true nature is ,  each toy seems prologue to some great amiss .	0
i must go in .	0
tis he ,  that villain romeo .	0
his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy ,  nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death .	0
by my troth ,  my lord ,  i cannot tell what to think of it ,  but that she loves him with an enraged affection ,  it is past the infinite of thought .	0
hamlet in madness hath polonius slain, and from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.	0
our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .	0
if thou didst it ,  thou art the nonpareil .	0
will damage your reputation with them—and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre .	0
sir toby needs help right away .	0
here ,  madam .	0
when i think ,  i must speak .	0
where have you this ?	0
you are too evil for words !	0
i mean, lay my head on your lap?	0
there must be some mistake ,  sir .	0
our advance will so dazzle the enemy that england will cower in fear and surrender .	0
i think you’re right ,  sir .	0
why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath ?	0
where's romeo's man ?	0
there they launched us ,  to cry to the sea that roared at us ,  to sigh to the winds ,  whose pity ,  sighing back again ,  only did us loving wrong .	0
is't possible?	0
i hope to make the sender blush for it .	0
varro !	0
gentleman ,  i am not the same man i was before .	0
wait ,  look !	0
how far that little candle throws his beams !	0
had i been any god of power, i would have sunk the sea within the earth, or ere it should the good ship so have swallowed and the fraughting souls within her.	0
you know not what you do .	0
what ,  my gracious lord ?	0
thy thoughts i cleave to.	0
do you need my help ?	0
i do i know not what and fear to find mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind .	0
i rather think you haven’t sought her help ,  by whose soft grace ,  i have received her royal aid for a similar loss ,  and i am at peace .	0
stand away ,  captain gower .	0
be curst and brief .	0
capulet, montage, see what a scourge is laid upon your hate, that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!	0
very humid ,  i can’t tell you how humid it is .	0
let’s go .	0
lo ,  where he comes !	0
have you importun'd him by any means?	0
i don’t know where he lives; and for me to make up a lodging, and say he lies here or he lies there is to lie in my own throat.	0
thy loving father ,  hamlet .	0
a light, a light!	0
little pitchers have big ears .	0
that’s the deal .	0
pray you ,  let’s sit together .	0
what?	0
but how hath she received his love ?	0
and we’ll wear out in a walled prison packs and sects of great ones that ebb and flow by the moon .	0
the will of man is by his reason sway'd ,  and reason says you are the worthier maid .	0
the less they deserve it ,  the more credit it is to you .	0
here, peter quince.	0
more and more pain for us .	0
it’s stopped;—and surely, it’s for some god of the island.	0
he was a man ,  take him for all in all ,  i shall not look upon his like again .	0
but ,  alas the while !	0
all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavor .	0
my plenteous joys ,  wanton in fullness ,  seek to hide themselves in drops of sorrow .	0
father'd he is ,  and yet he's fatherless .	0
a greater gift ?	0
god alive !	0
with any luck ,  the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind .	0
ancient, conduct them; you best know the place.	0
yes ,  yes ,  the ropes .	0
have a good night .	0
good - morrow ,  friends .	0
upon the talk of the poisoning?	0
but for all that ,  to my thinking ,  he would fain have had it .	0
publius ,  good cheer ,  there is no harm intended to your person ,  nor to no roman else .	0
o ,  here they come .	0
don’t be lost so badly in your thoughts .	0
the taming school ?	0
right ,  i mean you .	0
nay ,  i will do so .	0
give you good night.	0
that’s fouler .	0
are you going to watch the race ?	0
when all these extraordinary things happen at once ,  we shouldn’t say ,   “ these happenings can be explained rationally .	0
maybe you think that i think you’re in love .	0
no ,  my noble lord ,  it is not for you .	0
zounds ,  a dog ,  a rat ,  a mouse ,  a cat ,  to scratch a man to death !	0
only god above deal between you and me!	0
it is myself, i mean, in whom i know all the particulars of vice are so grafted that, when they shall be opened, black macbeth will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state will respect him as a lamb, being compared with my unlimited evils.	0
dry sorrow drinks our blood .	0
o ,  the heavens !	0
that villain ,  romeo .	0
well ,  my lord .	0
no ,  you must see them as your father sees them .	0
is it new and old too ?	0
all my engagements i will construe to thee, all the charactery of my sad brows.	0
you’ll be pricked all over ,  and it’ll sting like bees .	0
fare you well .	0
why should he call her a whore ?	0
tell me .	0
don’t forget the vows we made to each other .	0
what mercy can you show him ,  antonio ?	0
go with me to the tomb .	0
you are jealous now that this is from some mistress, some gift.	0
what does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?	0
by computation and mine host’s report ,  i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart .	0
he taught me how to know a man in love ,  in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner .	0
but you had better get back to egypt again .	0
a mature age .	0
this feather moved because of her breath .	0
whom you swore you would protect and defend .	0
see, they greet you with their hearts' thanks.	0
all's well .	0
it is not needed yet .	0
what's the matter now?	0
tranio ,  i think i’ve got it !	0
but what prevention ?	0
yes ,  the state’s half can be reduced ,  but not antonio’s .	0
out ,  out ,  you loose woman ,  fortune !	0
what should i say to you?	0
oh ,  then i guess she was old and gentle ,  and you rode barelegged ,  like an irish yokel .	0
why ,  farewell ,  portia .	0
away ,  slight man !	0
i am sure i am none such .	0
montague !	0
starveling!	0
only yesterday, the word of caesar might have stood against the world.	0
nay ,  then ,  thus: we came into the world like brother and brother ,  and now let’s go hand in hand ,  not one before another .	0
all right ,  go ahead ,  keep up your little game ,  pretend to be sympathetic ,  but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when i turn my back .	0
don’t listen to him ,  emilia ,  even though he’s your husband .	0
your worship's friend ,  and launcelot ,  sir .	0
he speaks well .	0
my noble father ,  i see a divided duty here .	0
o ,  you are well tuned now !	0
i know you not .	0
no, no; he's gone.	0
no sound ,  no word ?	0
that's my noble master !	0
now am i dead, now am i fled; my soul is in the sky.	0
may ’t please your majesty to give us leave freely to render what we have in charge ,  or shall we sparingly show you far off the dauphin’s meaning and our embassy ?	0
what’s done cannot be undone.	0
the instances that second marriage move are base respects of thrift, but none of love.	0
now die ,  die ,  die ,  die ,  die .	0
here ,  quite confused by this mutiny .	0
for the favor of sleeping in her bed .	0
cassio ,  my lord ?	0
gentlemen all—alas, what shall i say?	0
so ,  so ,  so ,  so !	0
i’m glad he wasn’t here for this fight .	0
long live she so !	0
be assured you may.	0
ambition shouldn’t be so soft .	0
we are free from his tyranny .	0
what do you think about it ?	0
not tonight ,  good iago .	0
i do not think so .	0
my lord ,  i did; but answer made it none .	0
so why did you laugh when i said that men don’t interest me ?	0
she’s full of good intentions .	0
look to the queen there, ho!	0
stood the state so ?	0
dinner is over ,  and we’re going to get there too late .	0
don’t snap at me .	0
the earth ,  that is ,  nature's mother ,  is nature’s tomb .	0
both of you know banquo was your enemy.	0
what are you doing ?	0
o heavens!	0
thrice hath calphurnia in her sleep cried out ,   “ help ,  ho !	0
well ,  we all have our special gifts .	0
and how did she react to all this ?	0
how amazing !	0
it’s definitely maria’s handwriting .	0
i’ll show thee the best springs .	0
the canker galls the infants of the spring too oft before their buttons be disclosed, and in the morn and liquid dew of youth contagious blastments are most imminent.	0
what man is there so very unreasonable, that, if you had bothered to defend it with any terms of earnestness, lacked the modesty to encourage the thing be held as a ceremony?	0
he may recover yet .	0
if our criminal master gets off free ,  i won’t care what happens to me anymore .	0
behold ,  here i lie ,  never to rise again .	0
yes .	0
here comes sir toby ,  limping .	0
yes ,  honest .	0
he is sad and civil and suits well for a servant with my fortunes .	0
e'en at hand ,  alighted by this .	0
when he is asleep drunk ,  or in his rage ,  or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed ,  at gaming ,  swearing ,  or committing some act that has no element of salvation in it ,  then attack him ,  so that his heels may kick at heaven ,  and that his soul may be as damned and black as hell ,  where it goes to .	0
brutus killed me .	0
never.	0
night ,  hide me awhile .	0
so please ,  old friend ,  give us some good advice .	0
hey ,  roderigo !	0
get me ink and paper, and hire some horses.	0
this thou shalt answer .	0
what have you got on your head ?	0
oh god ,  do i have to remember that ?	0
if i should say ,  i saw such islanders— for ,  certes ,  these are people of the island— who ,  though they are of monstrous shape ,  yet note ,  their manners are more gentle - kind than of our human generation you shall find many—nay ,  almost any .	0
ha, ha!	0
filths savor but themselves .	0
that did i ,  my lord ,  and was accounted a good actor .	0
madam !	0
you couldn’t beat the two of them apart .	0
silence!	0
you’ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of gonzago’s wife .	0
some of you go to decius’s house and some to casca’s .	0
sex and marriage are honorable things—even for a beggar ,  right ?	0
we should speak what we feel ,  not what we ought to say .	0
well ,  do whatever you think best .	0
i understand a fury in your words, but not the words.	0
everyone else will have to stay single .	0
speak .	0
then it’s getting close to the time when the spirit has his habit of walking.	0
do you not know me, father?	0
thus with a kiss i die .	0
o villain ,  villain ,  smiling ,  damned villain !	0
how could i honorably give him what i’ve already given you ?	0
give him a halter: i am famished in his service; you may tell every finger i have with my ribs .	0
why, you—loss on loss!	0
i will chop her into messes.	0
and they have been grand - jurymen since before noah was a sailor .	0
your brother don john the bastard has run away from messina .	0
and so did i.	0
if charnel houses and our graves must send those that we bury back ,  our monuments shall be the maws of kites .	0
with demetrius .	0
do you quarrel, sir?	0
nay ,  that's not your way .	0
good hay ,  sweet hay ,  hath no fellow .	0
the old cock .	0
the one of them contains my picture, prince; if you choose that, then i am yours withal.	0
o, your only dancer!	0
but now ,  i tell thee—keep it to thyself— this day those enemies are put to death ,  and i in better state than e'er i was .	0
good mistress accost ,  i desire better acquaintance .	0
this same is she ,  and i do give you her .	0
a flatterer's would not ,  though they do appear as huge as high olympus .	0
he is a gentleman of a good family ,  and for his ransom ,  he will give you two hundred crowns .	0
know that i am brutus !	0
therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong; therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.	0
mr .  bassanio ! — gratiano !	0
what’s all the noise in here ?	0
quiet ,  quiet ,  iras .	0
but how strange that beatrice should seem to know who i was and yet not know at the same time .	0
see where she comes from shrift with merry look .	0
would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?	0
shall she come in ?	0
thus was i ,  sleeping ,  by a brother’s hand of life ,  of crown ,  of queen at once dispatched ,  cut off even in the blossoms of my sin ,	0
were never orphans had so dear a loss .	0
a peevish school boy, worthless of such honor, join'd with a masker and a reveller!	0
i drew to part them .	0
to ferdinand] what is this maid with whom thou [to ferdinand] what is this maid with whom thou wast at play ?	0
they’ll have me whipped for speaking true ,  thou'lt have me whipped for lying ,  and sometimes i am whipped for holding my peace .	0
what ,  are you mad ?	0
and she’s loyal ,  as she has proven .	0
easily ,  madam .	0
lives, sir.	0
peter ,  wait for me at the gate .	0
your power and your command is taken off and cassio rules in cyprus .	0
this torture should be roar'd in dismal hell .	0
i was always plain with you, and so now i speak my agitation of the matter: therefore, be of good chee; for, truly, i think you are damned.	0
or the antidote for stinging plants or hollyhocks.	0
you go to juliet ,  help her ready .	0
tell me seriously ,  who is the one you love ?	0
it may be these apparent signs, the unaccustomed weather of this night, and persuasion of his men who tell the future may keep him from the capitol today.	0
sir ,  for your hurts ,  myself will be your surgeon .	0
well ,  i’m sorry for you ,  gentle silvius .	0
yes, caliban her son.	0
good madam!	0
where art thou now ?	0
he's gone ,  he's killed ,  he's dead !	0
therefore tell me ,  fairest katherine ,  will you have me ?	0
welcome ,  gentlemen !	0
what effects ,  my lord ?	0
i should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it ,  but you started fighting with me first .	0
call up the master constable dogberry .	0
don’t forget to come to our feast.	0
even if i went to church and saw the holy building of stone, i’d be thinking right away about dangerous rocks, which, touching only my gentle vessel's side, would scatter all her spices across the water, spreading my silk cargo across the roaring waters, and, in a word, one minute worth this amount of money, and now worth nothing.	0
yes ,  what about it ?	0
for god's love let me hear !	0
i do but keep the peace .	0
what shall i do?	0
but what of cicero ?	0
fairies ,  skip hence; i have forsworn his bed and company .	0
fie upon't !	0
yes ,  it is .	0
come ,  night .	0
for brutus' sake ,  i am beholding to you .	0
marry ,  sir ,  because silver hath a sweet sound .	0
why then, you left me,—o, the gods forbid!— in earnest, shall i say?	0
i had myself notice of my brother’s purpose herein and have by underhand means labored to dissuade him from it; but he is resolute .	0
give me some help.	0
i'll make my trip around the world in forty minutes.	0
what's in a name?	0
why, if two gods should play some heavenly match, and on the wager lay two earthly women, and portia one, there must be something else pawn'd with the other; for the poor rude world hath not her fellow.	0
macbeth!	0
but how has she received his love ?	0
honey, cyprus will be very glad to see you; i have found great love among them.	0
knock ,  knock ,  knock !	0
come, a passionate speech.	0
it is my soul that calls my name .	0
did you see the gloomy lord northumberland ?	0
i throw my warlike shield before my body .	0
fear comes upon me .	0
she says enough; yet she's a simple rabbit that cannot say as much.	0
ariel ,  you’ve done your work exactly as i ordered .	0
popilius lena speaks not of our purposes; for, look, he smiles, and caesar doth not change.	0
she is in a better place .	0
don’t say anything bad about wine anymore .	0
since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is't to leave betimes?	0
with a web as little as this, i’ll catch as big a fly as cassio.	0
use them after your own honour and dignity .	0
go get some water ,  and wash this filthy witness from your hands .	0
marry ,  go before to field ,  he'll be your follower !	0
had i a glass ,  i would .	0
it is not expressly stated; but so what ?	0
let’s go.	0
what many men desire.—that many may be meant by the fool multitude, that choose by show, not learning more than the fond eye doth teach; which pries not to th' interior, but, like the martlet, builds in the weather on the outward wall, even in the force and road of casualty.	0
your “love” is lying there.	0
let's make us medicines of our great revenge, to cure this deadly grief.	0
o hamlet ,  thou hast cleft my heart in twain .	0
come ,  let’s go to the king; our power is ready; the only thing is missing is our leaving .	0
both your majesties might ,  by the sovereign power you have of us ,  put your dread pleasures more into command than to entreaty .	0
i bring thee tidings of the prince's doom .	0
it can’t be anything else.	0
for nature ,  crescent ,  does not grow alone in thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes ,  the inward service of the mind and soul grows wide withal .	0
trade me for a goat when i shall turn the business of my soul to such puffed up and blown suspicions ,  matching your suggestion .	0
ok, that’s fine.	0
is ’t come to this ?	0
o ,  pardon ,  sir ,  it doth ,  and yon grey lines that fret the clouds are messengers of day .	0
o simple!	0
tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .	0
it does have a back like a weasel’s .	0
give me my robe, for i will go.	0
your children shall be kings .	0
upon what ground ?	0
damn it !	0
for all the rest ,  let lion ,  moonshine ,  wall ,  and the two lovers ,  tell you while they stay here .	0
ariel ,  thy charge exactly is performed .	0
we don’t think so, my lord.	0
come ,  let’s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .	0
behold how like a maid she blushes here !	0
the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol ,  his glory not extenuated ,  wherein he was worthy ,  nor his offenses enforced ,  for which he suffered death .	0
it waves me still .	0
i know our country’s disposition well; in venice they let heaven see the pranks they wouldn’t dare show their husbands; their best conscience isn’t to leave it unfinished ,  but to keep it unknown .	0
weeping and wailing over tybalt's corse.	0
oh ,  i could weep my spirit from mine eyes .	0
come ,  stand not amazed at it ,  but go along with me; i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to kill him .	0
come hither ,  fellow .	0
peace there !	0
i'll have some proof .	0
so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again ,  to both your honours .	0
but ,  i pray you ,  let none of your people stir me; i have an exposition of sleep come upon me .	0
where is this sight ?	0
what news among the merchants ?	0
greater than both ,  by the all - hail hereafter !	0
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .	0
will you come to bed ,  my lord ?	0
what says that fool of hagar’s offspring ,  ha ?	0
hark ,  come hither ,  tyrrel .	0
nay ,  ’tis twice two months ,  my lord .	0
what two crowns shall they be ?	0
would your honor like to try this dried fruit ?	0
cut yourself ?	0
make we our march towards birnam	0
and from my soul too; else beshrew them both.	0
get them in here—nathaniel ,  joseph ,  nicholas ,  philip ,  walter ,  sugarsop ,  and the rest .	0
murder !	0
no .	0
where's your father?	0
no ?	0
this is the abscess of much wealth and peace ,  that breaks inward ,  and shows no damage until the man dies .	0
say your prayers; say your prayers !	0
get on your nightgown, in case we are called by chance and it shows us to be watchers.	0
meet me right away at the harbor.	0
what hast thou found ?	0
honestly ,  sir ,  we say that we are not criminals .	0
if i’m going be killed, there is no time like caesar's death-hour, or any instrument half as worthy as your swords, decorated richly with the most noble blood in this whole world.	0
have you heard of no likely wars toward ’twixt the two dukes of cornwall and albany ?	0
farewell and hurry to do your duty .	0
shouldn’t i say “has a dog got money?	0
he waxes desperate with imagination .	0
who ,  i ,  my lord ?	0
i wish your ladyship all heart's content .	0
macbeth is ripe for shaking ,  and the powers above put on their instruments .	0
look ,  here comes just the man we were looking for .	0
he does, because he asked antonius to send word to you that he would be there tomorrow.	0
give me that boy and i will go with thee .	0
no, monster, not i.	0
thou hast done a deed— i care not for thy sword ,  i’ll make thee known	0
thou shalt be free .	0
take time to think about it; and, by the next new moon,— the wedding day of my love and me, for the everlasting bond of fellowship,— on that day either prepare to die because you have disobeyed your father's will; or else marry demetrius, as your father wants you to; or accept the austerity and single life of a nun.	0
is it so, countrymen?	0
it is a common thing… ha!	0
he holds me well; the better shall my purpose work on him .	0
o ,  do not do your cousin such a wrong !	0
all dead .	0
are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?	0
you and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well ,  and now i need your help again .	0
my naked weapon is out .	0
there are no tongues else for ’s turn .	0
now counterfeit to swoon ,  why ,  now fall down; or if thou canst not ,  oh ,  for shame ,  for shame ,  lie not ,  to say mine eyes are murderers .	0
i like not that .	0
when will there be another like him ?	0
how have i been behaved, that he might stick the small'st opinion on my least misuse?	0
we all expect a gentle answer, jew.	0
if i default ,  he’ll pay you .	0
i do attend here on the general; and think it no addition ,  nor my wish ,  to have him see me woman'd .	0
hail ,  mortal !	0
get you a place .	0
as sure as i’m standing here ,  i saw him .	0
they’ll mar my counterfeiting .	0
jove ,  jove ,  this shepherd’s passion is much upon my fashion .	0
in venice they do let god see the pranks they dare not show their husbands .	0
patience ,  gentle audrey .	0
come, let me wipe your face.	0
i can’t enjoy either of them as long as the other one’s alive .	0
dear god ,  please make him normal again !	0
why, no; the day dawned before we parted.	0
portia ,  what mean you ?	0
no ,  cassio wasn’t killed .	0
he said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?	0
no .	0
get thee gone .	0
duke ,  please go ahead with your state business .	0
here was he merry ,  hearing of a song .	0
oh dear !	0
nor i ,  my lord .	0
demetrius is a worthy gentleman .	0
and mine shall .	0
i forgive you the praise .	0
is not parchment made of sheepskins?	0
see for the news .	0
what is it thou didst say ?	0
i should have been a sore one ,  then .	0
i’ll go now to find out the date of the wedding .	0
gentle mercutio ,  put thy rapier up .	0
but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband:—o me, the word choose!	0
but art thou not advised ,  he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ?	0
a beast that lacks the gift of reason ,  would have mourned longer— married my uncle ,  my father's brother ,  but no more like my father than i am like hercules .	0
let them be well used ,  for they are the short stories and brief history of the time .	0
for none neither .	0
you swore to me ,  when i did give it you ,  that you would wear it till your hour of death; and that it should lie with you in your grave: though not for me ,  yet for your vehement oaths ,  you should have been respective ,  and have kept it .	0
those tears will bring blessings to you .	0
i think the sun where he was born drew all such humors from him .	0
o lord, they fight!	0
and launcelot ,  soon at supper shalt thou see lorenzo ,  who is thy new master’s guest .	0
come hither ,  good volumnius ,  list a word .	0
where ,  my lord ?	0
there lies the man ,  slain by young romeo ,  that slew thy kinsman ,  brave mercutio .	0
here’s decius brutus .	0
mercy ,  mercy !	0
hearts ,  tongues ,  figures ,  scribes ,  bards ,  poets ,  cannot think ,  speak ,  cast ,  write ,  sing ,  number—hoo ! — his love to antony .	0
i do not find that thou deal’st justly with me .	0
could you have found two romans as good as these two ?	0
he that keeps nor crust nor crumb ,   weary of all ,  shall want some .	0
goodbye ,  then .	0
how fares your majesty ?	0
is there division 'twixt my lord and cassio?	0
dost thou love me?	0
love news, in faith.	0
rather your eyes must with his judgment look .	0
i cannot be so answer’d .	0
he did ,  from first to last .	0
and because i know how fond she is of music ,  playing her instruments ,  and poetry ,  i plan to hire live - in tutors for her .	0
look how she rubs her hands.	0
i know my medicine will work on him .	0
o wherefore, nature, didst thou lions frame?	0
if you steal my money ,  you’re just stealing trash .	0
can’t you talk about anything besides ladies ?	0
the most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is .	0
her name, that was as fresh as dian's visage, is now begrimed and black as mine own face.	0
and his unbookish jealousy must construe poor cassio’s smiles ,  gestures ,  and light behavior quite in the wrong . —how do you now ,  lieutenant ?	0
thou hast taken against me a most just exception; but yet, i protest, have dealt most directly in thy affair.	0
i had my father’s signet in my purse ,  which was the model of that danish seal .	0
what does the silver one say ?	0
didn’t a woman give birth to him ?	0
horatio says ’tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him touching this dreaded sight twice seen of us .	0
whose grave is this ,  sir ?	0
how dangerous to have this madman on the loose !	0
oh wall ,  you have heard my moans very often ,  for separating my fair pyramus and me .	0
against my will i am sent to bid you come in to dinner .  ”  there’s a double meaning in that .	0
i will anon; first, let us go to dinner.	0
i’ll to the mart ,  and there for dromio stay .	0
well ,  death's the end of us all .	0
watch me: stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .	0
i am myself indifferent honest ,  but yet i could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me .	0
how else is he the  “ man in the moon ”  ?	0
yes ,  thoroughly .	0
the will!	0
why ,  thou silly gentleman !	0
don’t say what you’re thinking ,  and don’t be too quick to act on what you think .	0
why ,  lady !	0
whereto serves mercy but to confront the visage of offence ?	0
true, madam; he, that, of all the men that i have ever seen with my foolish eyes, was the most deserving of a beautiful lady.	0
what is the matter there?	0
beshrew your eyes ,  they have o'erlook'd me ,  and divided me; one half of me is yours ,  the other half yours , — mine own ,  i would say; but if mine ,  then yours ,  and so ,  all yours: o !	0
but ,  hold thee ,  take this garland on thy brow .	0
it is my fashion ,  when i see a crab .	0
you give your best praise to the worst women .	0
so let’s join forces and get revenge .	0
prithee ,  put up .	0
here’s our own hands against our hearts .	0
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.	0
god, god, forgive us all!	0
so can i .	0
fetch that gallant hither .	0
news ,  friends: our wars are done ,  the turks are drown'd .	0
i would’ve been a sore king then .	0
to me ,  sir ?	0
that i can keep your advice ,  and not my own .	0
to bed ,  to bed; there's knocking at the gate .	0
edmund ,  where’s your wicked brother ?	0
gifts that god gives .	0
are there parties?	0
do you note me?	0
that you must teach me .	0
the more i hate, the more he follows me.	0
mark me .	0
oh ,  what a wonderful new world ,  that has such people in it !	0
all is confirmed ,  my lord ,  which was reported .	0
in troth, i think i should, and undo't when i had done.	0
the testament!	0
who's there ?	0
so go ahead and have your terrifying fun .	0
witness the hole you made in caesar's heart, crying, "long live!	0
talk no more.	0
you’re right .	0
just a minute ago i was the owner of this beautiful mansion ,  master of these servants ,  and queen over myself .	0
where is this man ?	0
take you ,  as ’twere ,  some distant knowledge of him ,  as thus:  “ i know his father and his friends ,  and ,  in part ,  him .  ”  do you mark this ,  reynaldo ?	0
o villain!	0
a hall a hall!	0
he was only a fool that brought my answer back .	0
what a jaunt i have had !	0
they’re just flattering me .	0
then learn this from me: if you have something ,  you have it .	0
how are you ,  my good lady ?	0
love news ,  in faith ?	0
we need a calendar !	0
stay yet .	0
i hear him coming.	0
belong you to the lady olivia ,  friends ?	0
so i guess it’s you ,  you silver treasure house .	0
this castle hath a pleasant seat; the air nimbly and sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses.	0
welcome ,  my lord .	0
what do you mean by this?	0
maybe ,  but i wish i’d never laid eyes on him .	0
pause awhile ,  and let my counsel sway you in this case .	0
madam ,  what should i do ?	0
how can that be, unless she drown'd herself in her own defence?	0
my ears haven’t yet heard a hundred words of that tongue's speech ,  and yet i know the sound; aren’t you romeo ,  and a montague ?	0
this dagger hath mista'en ,  for ,  lo ,  his house is empty on the back of montague ,  and it missheathed in my daughter's bosom !	0
yes ,  i will; and i'll be wise hereafter ,  and seek for grace .	0
and all for nothing!	0
if we do meet again ,  we'll smile indeed; if not ,  'tis true this parting was well made .	0
that methinks is strange .	0
why ,  you’re sober enough now .	0
which one is sebastian ?	0
that last is true .	0
and then ,  of so gentle a disposition !	0
you are a tame man; go !	0
what a silly monster ,  to think a poor drunk is wonderful .	0
the ground indeed is tawny.	0
come hither, my dear hamlet, sit by me.	0
what soldiers ,  whey - face ?	0
were you the doctor, and i knew you not?	0
drink up .	0
there is no terror ,  cassius ,  in your threats ,  for i am armed so strong in honesty that they pass by me as the idle wind ,  which i respect not .	0
it is lodovico come from the duke .	0
i’ll do that, my lord.	0
what do you think you’re doing ?	0
and that is claudio .	0
i remember a lot, but nothing clearly, a quarrel, but not why.	0
so shall you feel the loss ,  but not the friend which you weep for .	0
sweetheart, goodbye!	0
he uses his folly like a stalking - horse ,  and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .	0
lord ,  ”  he calls you ?	0
don’t cry ,  don’t cry .	0
each day new widows howl ,  new orphans cry ,  and new sorrows slap heaven in the face ,  until it sounds like heaven itself feels scotland’s anguish and screams in pain .	0
the princes are under some strange misunderstanding .	0
well shone ,  moon ! —truly ,  the moon shines with a good grace .	0
i wish i were satisfied!	0
give our officers notice of our intentions .	0
you’ve been competing with this king for my daughter .	0
be not so .	0
moth !	0
stand away from the hearse .	0
who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserves.	0
tybalt would kill thee ,  but thou slew’st tybalt—there art thou happy .	0
he will divorce you; or apply to you what restraint and grievance the law will allow him to do, with all his might to do it.	0
thriftless ambition ,  that will plunder your own life's means !	0
then crush this herb into lysander's eye; its juice has the virtuous property of removing all error from his eyes and will make his eyeballs roll with correct sight.	0
this is the man .	0
but where’s the money ?	0
thirsty sorrow drinks our blood.	0
royal lear ,  whom i have ever honored as my king ,  loved as my father ,  as my master followed ,  as my great patron thought on in my prayers— the bow is bent and drawn .	0
i prithee do not mock me, fellow student.	0
only i have left to say, more is thy due than more than all can pay.	0
oh ,  speak of that .	0
under what captain serve you ?	0
i see thou knowest me not.	0
signior hortensio ,  ’twixt such friends as we few words suffice .	0
light!	0
portia ,  goodbye to you .	0
i tricked your own eyes .	0
we passed them on the way, and they are coming here to perform.	0
i think it can be no other reason but that .	0
his words were ,   “ farewell ,  mistress .  ”  nothing else .	0
but did you ever tell him she was false?	0
if such tricks as these strip you of your lieutenantry ,  it would’ve been better you hadn’t kissed your three fingers so often ,  with which you are again very ready to play the gent .	0
let the air they ride on be infected and let all those that trust them be damned !	0
i forced to send the ring after him; i was overcome with shame and courtesy; my honor would not let ingratitude so much offend it .	0
thus says my king:  “ say thou to harry of england ,  though we seemed dead ,  we did but sleep .	0
oh, dear judgment, how his words are suited!	0
but he which bore my letter, friar john, was stay'd by accident, and yesternight return'd my letter back.	0
i am not cinna the conspirator .	0
farewell, my lord.	0
will you do that for me ,  silvius ?	0
a prison like that would give me enough liberty .	0
stanley ,  what news do you have ?	0
that shall be by and by .	0
great duke ,  be merciful to mortal men .	0
with all of them at once: they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix .	0
beat them down !	0
i’ve worked it out .	0
an annoying schoolboy ,  unworthy of such an honor ,  joined by a masquerader and a partier !	0
is it so ,  countrymen ?	0
sit you too .	0
i do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish ,  but an islander that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .	0
and yet i fear you; because you are deadly when your eyes roll so .	0
i feel awful for my cousin .	0
it is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in the mean; superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency lives longer.	0
i did love you once .	0
ha ,  ha !	0
my lord ,  i think i saw him last night .	0
this blue-eyed hag was brought here, pregnant, and was left here by sailors.	0
and if i ,  your poor devoted servant ,  may ask you for one small favor ,  you will guarantee my happiness forever .	0
foh!	0
why ,  what effects of passion shows she ?	0
but i’ll get you a candle and paper and ink .	0
i hereby declare we will have no more marriage .	0
o me !	0
come ,  come ,  you’ll never meet a more sufficient man .	0
stand from the hearse, stand from the body.	0
he's very popular with this country’s masses, who like not in their minds, but with their eyes, and where it is so, the offender's punishment is important, but never the offense.	0
oh ,  please ,  prince dauphin !	0
what's the matter now ?	0
how came you ,  cassio ,  by that handkerchief that was my wife's ?	0
did you and he consent in cassio’s death ?	0
the duke of exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .	0
nay, i will.	0
let’s hear it .	0
i will do so.	0
look to the queen there, ho!	0
okay ,  just do this ,  noble catesby: sound out lord hastings ,  but make it seem as if you’re just mulling over the idea ,  that it hasn’t been firmed up yet .	0
i understand not what you mean by this .	0
get thee to a nunnery .	0
our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.	0
if to preserve this vessel for my lord from any other foul unlawful touch be not to be a strumpet, i am none.	0
but since i’ve gotten myself involved this far ,  because i’m so stupidly honest and because i like you so much ,  i’ll keep going .	0
o my dear brother !	0
it is as easy as lying.	0
he is welcome too.	0
but yet do i believe the origin and commencement of his grief sprung from neglected love . —how now ,  ophelia ?	0
what o' that ?	0
just as you’d like to have your sins forgiven ,  indulge me ,  forgive me ,  and set me free .	0
my soul is made out of lead ,  and it’s so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so i can’t move .	0
you told a lie ,  an odious ,  damned lie; upon my soul ,  a lie ,  a wicked lie !	0
who ?	0
i prithee ,  recount some of them .	0
and her cook yelled ,  mocked ,  and teased me ,  right ?	0
a foolish heart ,  that i leave here behind .	0
alas !	0
thrice - blessed they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage; but earthlier happy is the rose distill'd than that which ,  withering on the virgin thorn grows ,  lives ,  and dies ,  in single blessedness .	0
calling death ‘banishment,’ thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me.	0
there’s no power in venice that can change an established decree .	0
as for hamlet and the foolishness of his attentions ,  think that it is only a phase and a toy in blood .	0
ay ,  millstones ,  as he lessoned us to weep .	0
caesar ,  beware of brutus .	0
thou liest .	0
you have.	0
can any prayers get through to you ?	0
oh ,  where is romeo ?	0
why ,  good sir ?	0
we must die ,  messala .	0
in faith ,  i am sorry that you’re not well .	0
here is the man, this moor; whom now, it seems, your special mandate for the state affairs hath hither brought.	0
i know that ,  but i would have thee hence and here again .	0
he’s calling us back .	0
if it pleases you, something touching the lord hamlet.	0
nay ,  that follows not .	0
if only that were all it is— it is ,  i promise .	0
best safety lies in fear .	0
destiny chooses when you’ll die and who you’ll marry .	0
i only say what she is.	0
you were best knock louder .	0
i agree— put a mark next to his name too ,  antony .	0
bear with him ,  brutus; 'tis his fashion .	0
awakening] what angel wakes me from my flowery bed ?	0
oh ,  she knew well thy love did read by rote ,  that could not spell .	0
give me my money and let me go .	0
gladly i would dwell on form, gladly, gladly deny what i have spoken; but farewell polite words!	0
i flashed about faster than lightning .	0
i will kiss your lips .	0
no, make it two lines more.	0
it gives me wonder great as my content to see you here before me.	0
your fortitude has left you alone .	0
for none ,  neither .	0
do we know this face or not?	0
mark his condition and th’event; then tell me if this might be a brother .	0
o ,  welcome ,  father !	0
but if i were brutus ,  and if brutus were antony ,  there would be an antony to ruffle up your spirits ,  and put a tongue in every wound of caesar ,  that would move the stones of rome to rise and rebel .	0
my soul is stuck to sin ,  and the more it struggles to break free ,  the more it sticks .	0
i warrant it will.	0
god save you ,  sir !	0
oh ,  a good wish upon you .	0
do your job .	0
you may, indeed, say so; for 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.	0
mine ,  and most of our fortunes tonight ,  shall be—drunk to bed .	0
birnam wood .	0
i hope this passionate humor of mine will change .	0
tell me ,  friend .	0
i wish he were fatter!	0
peace then, no words.	0
i pray you ,  see him presently discharged ,  for he is bound to sea ,  and stays but for it .	0
go away ,  get out of here ,  and stop following me .	0
i am not merry, but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise.	0
call claudio and some of my other men .	0
well ,  then he must be alive .	0
why does the drum come here?	0
do we all holy rites .	0
you unwashed farmworker !	0
i am in my condition a prince ,  miranda—i do think ,  a king; i would ,  not so ! —and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the flesh - fly blow my mouth .	0
o ,  what more favor can i do to thee ,  than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain to sunder his that was thine enemy ?	0
here comes the good macduff .	0
what does he say ?	0
tell me your counsels ,  i will not disclose em .	0
are you answered ?	0
is my lord angry?	0
is that called for in the contract ?	0
if i do find him fit ,  i'll move your suit ,  and seek to effect it to my uttermost .	0
nay ,  he will answer the letter’s master ,  how he dares ,  being dared .	0
have you come to make confession to this father ?	0
how does my good lord hamlet?	0
i can’t ,  my lord .	0
what hempen home - spuns have we swagg'ring here ,  so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?	0
we will hear caesar's will.	0
hermia is lucky ,  wherever she is ,  because she has beautiful eyes .	0
besides—i ha' not since put up my sword— against the capitol i met a lion ,  who glazed upon me and went surly by without annoying me: and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear ,  who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets .	0
the words expressly are  “ a pound of flesh .  ”  take then thy bond ,  take thou thy pound of flesh ,  but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood ,  thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice .	0
arise .	0
let’s go .	0
i’m only crazy sometimes .	0
sir, you shall understand what has happened, which, as i think, you don’t know.	0
i’ll have you speak out the rest of this soon.	0
why do you sharpen your knife so earnestly?	0
the house will be the quieter .	0
where's the captain?	0
all things that exist are sought for with more spirit than the spirit to enjoy them .	0
anon his thisbe must be answered, and forth my mimic comes.	0
who’s calling for me ?	0
well ,  let me get back to my choice .	0
in that case it’s like the words of an unpaid lawyer .	0
although i hate her ,  i'll not harm her so .	0
well ,  girl ,  you are weeping not so much for his death as for the villain who lives who slaughtered him .	0
servant, a word with you.	0
now ,  what’s the news in the marketplace ?	0
good day to both of you .	0
aroint thee ,  witch !  ”  the rump - fed runnion cries .	0
haply when i shall wed that lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry half my love with him ,  half my care and duty .	0
give me my robe ,  for i will go .	0
it’s his wife ,  lady grey ,  who got him to do this .	0
children have lost—or no longer have time to learn—skills that should be a credit to our country .	0
i had a wound here that was like a  “ t ,  ”  but now ’tis made an  “ h .  ”                                                         they do retire .	0
yes ,  that was it .	0
all the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind .	0
look ,  in this place ran cassius' dagger through .	0
his means of death, his obscure burial— no trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, no noble rite nor formal ostentation, cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, that i must call't in question.	0
no ,  really ,  i’m not .	0
if i don’t love her ,  i’m completely	0
o hamlet, speak no more!	0
i’ll ask that again; for nothing can be wrong if she is well .	0
what !	0
go to the church: take the priest ,  the clerk ,  and some reasonably honest witnesses .	0
he's now in florence .	0
he’s very serious ,  which is right for someone in mourning like me .	0
why ,  whose is it ?	0
our business now is mourning and grief .	0
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve is three long hours; yet she is not come.	0
what do you say ?	0
wherefore storm you so ?	0
over there ,  where titinius mourns it .	0
farewell .	0
what is a man, if his chief good and use of his time is only to sleep and eat?	0
here are more of us .	0
i don’t find myself wanting to sleep.	0
i won’t be satisfied until i get even with him ,  wife for wife .	0
what can it not ?	0
yes ,  i know thee to be signior lucentio .	0
let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on !	0
a sweet woman !	0
not sad ,  my lord .	0
that every like is not the same, o caesar, the heart of brutus yearns to think upon!	0
we’ve been looking for him everywhere .	0
we cannot call her winds and waters sighs and tears .	0
i have a health for you .	0
believe me ,  lord ,  i think he cannot choose .	0
stand and unfold yourself .	0
the main descry stands in the hourly thought .	0
he hath confess'd.	0
the king is mad .	0
madam !	0
you speak all your part at once, cues, and all.	0
put up thy sword ,  or manage it to part these men with me .	0
he never did harm that i heard of .	0
that which i gave you.	0
no, cassius, no.	0
tush ,  i will stir about ,  and all things shall be well ,  i warrant thee ,  wife .	0
oh ,  my antonio !	0
what satisfaction can you have tonight ?	0
i did not think he had been acquainted with her .	0
what’s the problem that caesar and his senate must fix?	0
nobody’s that bad .	0
and all the faith ,  the virtue of my heart ,  the object and the pleasure of mine eye ,  is only helena .	0
will you give her o'er ?	0
god's bread!	0
bravely, my hard worker.	0
o ,  don’t tell me about fear !	0
here comes young master ganymede ,  my new mistress’s brother .	0
thou art a villain.	0
alas, alas!	0
if not ,  i'll die your maid: to be your fellow you may deny me ,  but i'll be your servant whether you will or no .	0
youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	0
oh ,  but i fear .	0
you are welcome to elsinore .	0
he has already been named king and has left for scone to be crowned .	0
in this slumbery agitation ,  besides her walking and other actual performances ,  what ,  at any time ,  have you heard her say ?	0
what, will these hands ne'er be clean?	0
will your highness please grace us with your royal company?	0
it would be good for you to do so much for charity.	0
is he still alive ,  good uncle ?	0
evil can come from good ,  just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days—which means we have to walk carefully .	0
some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper ,  and other of such vinegar aspect that they’ll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable .	0
hated potion ,  get away !	0
how strange i’m feeling !	0
will you tell me that?	0
no ,  by no means .	0
please come closer . — make the music louder ,  please !	0
leave us.	0
o, the pipes.	0
do you not hear him ?	0
i do .	0
god have mercy ,  grumio !	0
the king’s a dear boy with a heart of gold ,  he’s a lively lad ,  a wag ,  born of fine parents ,  good with his fists .	0
farewell .	0
twas a color he never liked .	0
here ,  i’ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage ,  which is waiting for us at the gate .	0
his wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he’s having .	0
i’ll chop her into pieces .	0
what shall i swear by ?	0
as far as i know ,  he’s not even dead .	0
shine out ,  fair sun ,  till i have bought a glass ,  that i may see my shadow as i pass .	0
now, sir, be judge yourself whether i in any just term am affined to love the moor.	0
sweet lord ,  you lie to me .	0
heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray !	0
where have  come here ,  boy .	0
we'll wait until you’re free.	0
forgive us our sins!	0
leave me, and do as i ask you.	0
i don’t expect caesar and antony will have a very friendly reunion .	0
twill endure wind and weather .	0
i’m going ,  i’m going .	0
lo ,  here’s the chain .	0
i warrant you .	0
you turn my eyes into my very soul, and there i see such black and grainy spots as will not leave their color.	0
do you hear?	0
have you a mind to sink ?	0
as he smiles, othello shall go crazy; and his ignorant jealousy must interpret poor cassio's smiles, gestures, and happy behavior all wrong.	0
don’t worry about me . —your sister and the duke are here .	0
tis no time to play now .	0
a marvelous witty fellow ,  i assure you ,  but i will go about with him . —come you hither ,  sirrah ,  a word in your ear .	0
tis far off, and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants.	0
but i paid attention to where cupid’s arrow fell .	0
to gonzalo] the air breathes upon us here most [to gonzalo] the air breathes upon us here most sweetly .	0
some to decius' house, and some to casca's, some to ligarius'.	0
so prepare to die .	0
if that you were the good sir rowland’s son ,  as you have whispered faithfully you were ,  and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limned and living in your face ,  be truly welcome hither .	0
wash me in steepdown gulfs of liquid fire !	0
good hermia ,  do not be so bitter with me .	0
to serve me well ,  you all should do me duty: teach me to be your queen ,  and you my subjects .	0
and anything else ?	0
please ,  don’t be sad ,  and don’t tell me how reluctant you are .	0
but when our vices become habits—oh ,  the sadness of it ! —the wise gods blind us ,  shade our better judgment ,  make us love our mistakes ,  and laugh as we strut to our ruin .	0
he doesn’t hear, he doesn’t make noise, he doesn’t move; the fool is dead, and i must conjure him up!	0
why ,  isn’t this better now than groaning for love ?	0
therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.	0
well ,  happiness to their sheets !	0
o ,  did he so ?	0
yes, my lord.	0
first ,  if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth ,  yet so much is my poverty of spirit ,  so mighty and so many my defects ,  that i would rather hide me from my greatness ,  being a bark to brook no mighty sea ,  than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapor of my glory smothered .	0
heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him !	0
go to ,  mum ,  you are he .	0
so, so, so, so.	0
now go and get me some booze .	0
i'll give you a wind for your sail .	0
wherefore to dover ?	0
what are you reading ,  teacher ?	0
i learned it in england ,  where ,  indeed ,  they are very powerful drinkers .	0
he's in his fit now ,  and does not talk after the wisest .	0
it is an honour that i dream not of .	0
so romeo would ,  were he not romeo call'd ,  retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title .	0
come on, trinculo, let us sing.	0
watch it ,  control your tongue .	0
your ear is good.	0
pretend to be very concerned about both the prince ,  who has compromised his honor by making the match ,  and claudio ,  whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who’s pretending to be a virgin .	0
brutus ,  a word with you .	0
i cannot tell .	0
downy windows ,  close ,	0
what's that, my lord?	0
this green plot shall be our stage ,  this hawthorn - brake our tiring - house ,  and we will do it in action as we will do it before the duke .	0
you say only “i,” and i shall poison that bare vowel more than the death-darting eye of the serpent hatched from an egg.	0
i will anon; first ,  let us go to dinner .	0
but if i were smart enough to get out of this forest ,  i’d be wise enough to satisfy myself .	0
indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him— dead — is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.	0
ay ,  sooth; so humbled ,  that he hath left part of his grief with me ,  to suffer with him .	0
how is’t with you ,  sir ?	0
very reverend signior, do you know my voice?	0
it’s late .	0
don’t you come to scold your tardy son ,  that ,  forgetting time and passion ,  lets the important acting of your dread command go by ?	0
it was ,  as i have seen it in his life ,  a silvery sable .	0
things have turned out so unluckily ,  sir ,  that we haven’t had time to convince our daughter to marry you .	0
tis a strange serpent .	0
thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.	0
let him thank me ,  who helped him get there .	0
oh ,  good old man ,  you’re a great example of that old work ethic ,  where people worked because it was their duty ,  not just for the money .	0
well ,  then ,  put your sword away .	0
poison ,  i see ,  has been his timeless end .	0
i do beseech you— chiefly that i might set it in my prayers— what is your name ?	0
if i should take a displeasure against you ,  look you—  thou wert but a lost monster .	0
is that the law ?	0
but here's my husband; and as much duty as my mother showed to you ,  preferring you before her father ,  so much i dispute that i may profess due to the moor ,  my lord .	0
goodbye .	0
it is certain ,  then ,  for cyprus .	0
unless my horse goes faster than expected ,  i will be back an hour or two after sunset .	0
your crown’s awry .	0
no better.	0
no words .	0
if it is ,  i suggest you don’t eat it .	0
tis a lost fear: man but a rush against othello's breast ,  and he retires .	0
to me you speak not .	0
and twenty of these puny lies i’ll tell ,  that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth .	0
sing it tonight .	0
no, by the rood, not so!	0
how long hath she been thus ?	0
one of them contains my picture .	0
you minion ,  you ,  are these your customers ?	0
if caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done the same thing.	0
now i’ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep clarence’s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing king edward’s sons .	0
undress the statues if they’re decorated in honor of caesar .	0
will you pluck your sword out of its holder by the handle ?	0
but let me try my luck on the boxes .	0
because i am all of the subjects that you have ,  who was first my own king; and here you chain me to this hard rock ,  while you keep from me the rest of the island .	0
those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .	0
yes ,  only she doesn’t see anything .	0
what’s that noise?	0
hast thou forgot her ?	0
some two months away ,  up higher toward the north ,  he first shines ,  and the high east stands ,  just as the capitol ,  directly here .	0
now ,  the next day was our sea - fight; and what to this was sequent thou know'st already .	0
am i not i' the right ,  old jephthah ?	0
who builds stronger than a mason, a shipbuilder, or a carpenter?	0
we do ,  my lord .	0
mad as the sea and wind when both contend which is the mightier.	0
live a little ,  be comforted a little ,  cheer up a little .	0
saint francis be my speed !	0
you liar ,  you respond better to the whip than to kindness !	0
i will make fast the doors, and gild myself with some more ducats, and be with you straight.	0
but, for your private satisfaction, because i love you, i’ll let you know.	0
now ,  my sweet lord ,  you know how much i like you .	0
now ,  where’s your master ?	0
give me some music .	0
did this in caesar seem ambitious?	0
indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .	0
come ,  come ,  good wine is a good familiar creature ,  if it be well used .	0
armed forces have already landed .	0
goodbye, my lord.	0
philomel with melody sing in our sweet lullaby.	0
they are here at the court ,  and ,  i think ,  they are already hired to play before him tonight .	0
but let it be .	0
how fearful and dizzy ’tis to cast one’s eyes so low !	0
what is the news ?	0
go carry them, and smear the sleepy guards with blood.	0
oh ,  she doth teach the torches to burn bright !	0
madam my interpreter ,  what says she ?	0
against some part of poland.	0
here is a wonder ,  if you talk of a wonder .	0
if hamlet give the first or second hit, or quit in answer of the third exchange, let all the battlements their ordnance fire; the king shall drink to hamlet's better breath, and in the cup an union shall he throw richer than that which four successive kings in denmark's crown have worn.	0
here, horrible shadow!	0
if you poison us ,  don’t we die ?	0
he were no lion ,  were not romans hinds .	0
when i’ve plucked this rose ,  i can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die .	0
gracious king ,  if it pleases you ,  we will bestow ourselves .	0
if you meet horatio and marcellus ,  the ones who will watch with me ,  tell them to hurry up .	0
a surgeon!	0
till birnam wood remove to dunsinane i cannot taint with fear .	0
they mean to warn us here at philippi, answering us before we demand answers of them.	0
now he denies it a bit ,  and tries to laugh it off .	0
my name is edgar ,  and i’m your father’s son .	0
here ,  my lord .	0
what do you say to a calf’s foot ?	0
yours by this hand .	0
how it grieved macbeth !	0
let me draw the curtains.	0
did you assay him to any pastime ?	0
for half thy wealth ,  it is antonio’s .	0
you see an ass - head of your own ,  do you ?	0
the baron of cawdor lives ,  a prosperous gentleman; and for me to be king is beyond belief ,  no more than to be baron of cawdor .	0
pull out your sword when i do: and when i raise my hand ,  you do the same ,  so that it falls on gonzalo .	0
much will be seen in that .	0
cassio ,  i love you; but never more be an officer of mine .	0
that's not so .	0
now get on with your story .	0
do you think alexander the great looked like this when he was buried ?	0
no .	0
you are too hot under the collar.	0
what upsets you ,  your highness ?	0
do you need lime and hair to speak better ?	0
makes no difference .	0
give your thoughts to yourself, and don’t act without thinking.	0
then let’s say you are sad because you are not happy; and it’s easy to say that because you laugh and leap and say you are happy, because you are not sad.	0
my life on her faith in me !	0
to cabin ,  silence !	0
please ,  dear ,  come here .	0
oh ,  mother nature ,  why did you create lions ?	0
o, she is lame!	0
swear by this bottle how you came here—i escaped on a barrel of wine ,  which the sailors heaved overboard ,  by this bottle !	0
you are i' the right ,  sir ,  ’tis for my mistress .	0
cassio doesn’t know you.	0
marry ,  my child ,  early next thursday morn ,  the gallant ,  young ,  and noble gentleman ,  the county paris ,  at saint peter’s church ,  shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .	0
ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest !	0
so fare you well, till we shall meet again.	0
he supp'd at my house; but i therefore shake not.	0
i had rather to adopt a child than get it . — come hither ,  moor .	0
methinks i see my cousin's ghost seeking out romeo ,  that did spit his body upon a rapier's point .	0
isn’t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of alexander the great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel ?	0
his discretion ,  i am sure ,  cannot carry his valor ,  for the goose carries not the fox .	0
did you speak of juliet?	0
what hands are here?	0
true ,  he has an excellent reputation .	0
when caesar says ,   “ do this ,  ”  it is performed .	0
the old man’s daughter told us all .	0
why did you send me out ,  brave cassius ?	0
says the fiend; away!	0
though his bark cannot be lost ,  yet it shall be tempest - tossed .	0
a grievous fault . —say ,  woman ,  didst thou so ?	0
and for that purpose i'll anoint my sword.	0
come ,  take away the  here comes master signior leonato with the sexton .	0
i thank my noble lord .	0
a jealous woman ,  a jealous woman !	0
is it a true thing ?	0
come, sisters, let’s cheer him up, and show him the best of our delights.	0
well ,  my lord .	0
he’s had a ship wrecked coming from tripolis .	0
how low am i, thou painted maypole?	0
silence that dreadful bell ,  it frights the isle from her propriety .	0
sweet doctor, you shall be my lover: when i am absent, then you can lie with my wife.	0
ask him to go in .	0
a beautiful voice ,  i swear .	0
then must i think you would not have it so.	0
where died she ?	0
god forbid that i snatch the crown from him .	0
good morning ,  worthy caesar .	0
come ,  give us a bit of your quality .	0
i mean ,  my lord ,  the fight of your person in trial .	0
i have a pain on my forehead here .	0
the chicken is burning ,  the pig is overcooked ,  the clock has already struck twelve ,  and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek .	0
sweet lord ,  if your lordship were at leisure ,  i should impart a thing to you from his majesty .	0
good old knight ,  collect them all together at my tent .	0
you shall hear more by midnight .	0
what satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?	0
shed thou no blood; nor cut thou less, nor more, but just a pound of flesh: if thou tak'st more, or less, than a just pound,—be it but so much as makes it light, or heavy, in the substance, or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple,—nay, if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair,— thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.	0
kings it makes gods ,  and meaner creatures kings .	0
but ,  hold thee ,  take this garland on thy brow; thy brutus bid me give it thee ,  and i will do his bidding .	0
i want to die ,  if what you’re going to say is not a solution to this problem .	0
nay ,  but say true ,  does it work upon him ?	0
regan gives good advice .	0
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us ,  sir .	0
you’re making a terrible racket out here !	0
i will fetch him .	0
more ,  i prithee ,  more .	0
is he still alive ?	0
it cannot be .	0
tell me, othello.	0
damned iago !	0
give us kind keepers, heavens!	0
oh ,  fate ,  come and cut the thread of my life .	0
farewell and hurry to do your duty.	0
there is tears for his love ,  joy for his fortune ,  honor for his valor ,  and death for his ambition .	0
it waves me forward again.	0
tomorrow is the happy day ,  audrey .	0
what is it, i beg your ladyship?	0
from soldiers .	0
what you have charged me with ,  that have i done— and more ,  much more .	0
not in a grave to lay one in ,  another out to have .	0
what ?	0
i’ll vouch for that .	0
see ,  it stalks away !	0
o vengeance !	0
come ,  come ,  we fear the worst .	0
anyway ,  go tell your master i am here .	0
what, ho!	0
let me not hinder ,  cassius ,  your desires; i'll leave you .	0
no ,  it begins again .	0
and i’ll call your husband here .	0
what devil was't that thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman - blind ?	0
i put my trust in you .	0
by heaven ,  i love you better than i love myself ,  because i came here only armed against myself .	0
accursed be that tongue that tells me so, for it hath cow'd my better part of man!	0
tis well you offer it behind her back; the wish would make else an unquiet house.	0
and has given proper appearance to his speech ,  my lord ,  with almost all the holy vows of heaven .	0
good day ,  catesby .	0
consent to swear .	0
that is the voice ,  or i am much mistaken ,  of portia .	0
we are not going to have enough food.	0
old cassius still .	0
must i bouge ?	0
my vision is dull .	0
had i it written ,  i would tear the word .	0
babbling senselessly ?	0
i am no child ,  no babe .	0
give me your pardon, sir.	0
peace !	0
not now to hear thee sing .	0
the moor is of a free and open nature, that thinks men honest that but seem to be so; and will as tenderly be led by the nose as asses are.	0
two thousand ducats a year from his land !	0
i’m sorry ,  but i memorized what i’m supposed to say here today ,  and that question isn’t part of the speech i learned .	0
come with me now ,  and help me out .	0
your grandfather of famous memory ,  an’t please your majesty ,  and your great - uncle edward the plack prince of wales ,  as i have read in the chronicles ,  fought a most prave pattle here in france .	0
pray you be ever known to patience .	0
i met the youthful lord at lawrence' cell; and gave him what proper love i might ,  not overstepping the bounds of modesty .	0
o, what a rogue and peasant slave am i!	0
nor i .	0
cassio's a proper man .	0
this one ,  and i will give her to you .	0
what if this cursed hand were thicker than itself with my brother's blood, isn’t there enough rain in the sweet heavens to wash it as white as snow?	0
tis she must do ’t ,  and ,  lo ,  the happiness !	0
let him run far away .	0
we respected the beat of the song ,  sir .	0
our dinner done and he not coming thither ,  i went to seek him .	0
i did very well note him .	0
i cannot draw a cart ,  nor eat dried oats .	0
good night to you both .	0
if i had known this young man was his son ,  i would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .	0
banquo and donalbain!	0
faith ,  the rumor goes that you shall marry her .	0
i’ll see you on the guards' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .	0
who's here ?	0
by no means ”  what ?	0
who's there ?	0
lay her in the earth ,  and may violets spring from her fair and unpolluted flesh !	0
messala ,  i have here receivèd letters that young octavius and mark antony come down upon us with a mighty power ,  bending their expedition toward philippi .	0
o cassius ,  brutus gave the word too early ,  who ,  having some advantage on octavius ,  took it too eagerly .	0
i’ll obey you until i can make bail .	0
how now, cassio!	0
that’s noble of you ,  master .	0
what wood is this before us ?	0
o brave monster !	0
where should i lose that handkerchief ,  emilia ?	0
i know she is a hateful ,  brawling scold .	0
let him bless you too .	0
hail to thee ,  lady !	0
it is very hot .	0
or docks ,  or mallows .	0
gracious ,  so please you ,  we will bestow ourselves .	0
is execution done on cawdor?	0
how are you going to live ?	0
what about falconbridge ,  that young english baron ?	0
for pyramus therein doth kill himself .	0
time has come round ,  and i’ll end where i began .	0
prithee ,  listen well .	0
what news ?	0
and i do think— or else this brain of mine doesn’t know the trail of policy as surely as it used to do—, that i have found the very cause of hamlet's lunacy.	0
what noise ?	0
i think i’m getting delirious .	0
if this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up ,  then i’ll lose my son twice .	0
i like you guys .	0
oh hell !	0
indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder , —a sound ,  but not in government .	0
come not in here ,  nuncle .	0
a good matter ,  surely .	0
it’s the lark that sings so out of tune ,  making such harsh noise .	0
give me my sin again.	0
thou flea ,  thou nit ,  thou winter cricket thou !	0
i’m left with nothing to do in this weak ,  idle peacetime ,  unless i want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about	0
well ,  you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .	0
my father wasn’t a traitor .	0
great happiness !	0
this is the way to trick gullible fools .	0
thou art like one of those fellows that ,  when he enters the confines of a tavern ,  claps me his sword upon the table and says  “ god send me no need of thee !  ”  and ,  by the operation of the second cup ,  draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .	0
i met the youthful lord at lawrence' cell ,  and gave him what becomèd love i might ,  not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .	0
who offered him the crown ?	0
this guy has legs like a man but fins for arms !	0
what was the last cry for?	0
cicero one!	0
infected be the air whereon they ride ,  and damn'd all those that trust them !	0
no .	0
oh brave touch !	0
not the adam from the garden of eden ,  but the adam from the jailhouse .	0
to find out you .	0
very gracious duke, listen with a gracious ear to my request, and let me find a contract in your voice to assist my simpleness.	0
o weary reckoning !	0
i know the glove is a glove .	0
my friends ,  listen .	0
bid him therefore consider of his ransom ,  which must proportion the losses we have borne ,  the subjects we have lost ,  the disgrace we have digested ,  which ,  in weight to reanswer ,  his pettiness would bow under .	0
will you be counted in the number of our friends, or shall we go on and not depend on you?	0
must i stand and crouch under your testy humor ?	0
good night ,  good brother .	0
i know the good king and queen have sent for you .	0
warrant thee ,  my man’s as true as steel .	0
nay ,  that’s certain .	0
wasn’t that cassio leaving my wife ?	0
i therefore apprehend and do attach thee for an abuser of the world ,  a practicer of arts inhibited and out of warrant . — lay hold upon him .	0
let’s go .	0
the galleys have sent a dozen sequential messengers this very night at one another's heels; and many of the consuls ,  awakened and meeting ,  are at the duke's already .	0
what do these master-less and gory swords mean by lying here with blood on them in this place of peace?	0
here, quite confounded with this mutiny.	0
give him the instructions for our amusing little contract ,  and i’ll go get the money for you right away .	0
the villain shall not ’scape .	0
don’t worry about the cost .	0
what ,  i ,  my lord ?	0
hurry up .	0
honor you .	0
what did he say ?	0
me either: i’m wide awake.	0
tell me .	0
yes ,  i swear .	0
murder!	0
worthy montano ,  you were wont be civil .	0
the moon, methinks, looks with a watery eye; and when she weeps, weeps every little flower; lamenting some enforced chastity.	0
you will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid: that’s your device .	0
proceed ,  moon .	0
i think i had .	0
what bastard doth not ?	0
more validity ,  more honorable state ,  more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo .	0
if we can do that ,  everything will be all right .	0
who’s next ?	0
what if i do obey ?	0
are you alive ?	0
yes, sir, but “while the grass grows”— the proverb is a bit old-fashioned.	0
for god’s sake ,  find a house to duck into .	0
well ,  don’t face off with me .	0
then please tell me he’s all right .	0
tell me but this; have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?	0
here stands the man—good .	0
if cassio do remain ,  he hath a daily beauty in his life that makes me ugly; and besides ,  the moor may unfold me to him; there stand i in much peril: no ,  he must die .	0
yes .	0
good morning ,  cousin is it morning ?	0
it’s true ,  they’re inconsistent .	0
i say ,  we will have no more marriages .	0
it’s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please .	0
what’s his name ?	0
what’s the treasure ,  uncle ?	0
my liberty .	0
maybe she can’t meet him .	0
i must wake her up .	0
what, dead, my dove?	0
and then again ,  it’s not so good ,  but only so - so .	0
hear'st thou of them ?	0
he dares not come there for the candle; for, you see, it is already in snuff.	0
this is the man .	0
i met the youthful lord at laurence’ cell and gave him what becomed love i might ,  not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .	0
indeed he is not fit .	0
oh ,  the difference of man and man !	0
if wolves had at thy gate howled that stern time ,  thou shouldst have said ,   “ good porter ,  turn the key ,  ”  all cruèls else subscribed .	0
knock knock knock, knock!	0
metellus cimber?	0
we’ll watch a whole play tomorrow .	0
i regret not observing him more closely before i told you to do that .	0
no more ,  i pray you .	0
but i do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them .	0
here ,  lord bassanio ,  swear to keep this ring .	0
will you know them then ?	0
your brothers ?	0
here is for thy pains.	0
save yourself, my lord.	0
i’m crying at how unworthy i am to give you what i want to give you and to take what i’m dying to have .	0
ebbing men ,  indeed ,  most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth .	0
why ,  how could she have been murdered ?	0
in any case, let thisbe have clean linen; and don’t let him that plays the lion cut his nails, because they shall hang out for the lion's claws.	0
he was becoming very spirited when he was in school .	0
by the way ,  i’m going home tomorrow ,  sir toby .	0
so much for this, sir; now shall you see the other.	0
o heart, don’t give up now, don’t ever let the soul of nero, the crazy emperor, enter this determined heart.	0
cicero one!	0
here's a change indeed !	0
now, i swear, she is a gentile and no jew.	0
dido was from carthage ,  not tunis .	0
give him tending .	0
a trim exploit ,  a manly enterprise ,  to conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes with your derision !	0
so ,  it will make us mad .	0
shame on you!	0
tis deeply sworn .	0
do so .	0
we will greet the time .	0
listen to my cause ,  and be silent ,  so you can hear .	0
the labor we delight in cures pain .	0
think yourself a baby, that you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, which are not sterling.	0
and haven’t we got affections ,  desires for sport ,  and frailty ,  as men have ?	0
no ,  ’tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church - door ,  but ’tis enough ,  ’twill serve .	0
yes, so, god be with you!	0
rest ,  rest ,  irritated spirit !	0
o heaven, that you would expose such companions, and put a whip in every honest hand to whip the rascals naked throughout the world, even from the east to the west!	0
did you invite him ,  sir ?	0
no ,  leave him alone .	0
speak to me what thou art .	0
let it appear so .	0
how fine my master is !	0
ha ,  ha ,  ha !	0
what, no more?	0
then she comes to me, and with wild looks, asks me to devise some means to get her of this second marriage, or right there, in my cell, she would kill herself.	0
now fare you well ,  good sir .	0
we found him in the churchyard .	0
now antony has to leave her completely .	0
i’m glad about it.	0
what other bond than secret romans that have spoke the word and will not palter ?	0
if i let myself do what i yearn to ,  i’d rip the flesh off your bones .	0
i pray you ,  sirs ,  lie in my tent and sleep; it may be i shall raise you by and by on business to my brother cassius .	0
is  would your mightiness care to wash his hands ?	0
what is my name?	0
but here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that i beat on him ,  told him i’d given him a thousand marks in gold ,  and then lied about my wife and my house .	0
i wanted to teach her how perfectly i love her ,  kinsman ,  and that’s good english .	0
he thinks he still is at his instrument .	0
when did i earn this scorn at your hands ?	0
tend to the master's whistle!	0
just ,  just; and the men do sympathize with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on ,  leaving their wits with their wives .	0
they stumble that run fast .	0
i want to head out tonight .	0
what strange reason could she have for coming here ?	0
come on ,  one more; two boys and two girls makes up four .	0
in that event, you gods, you make the weak the strongest; in that event, you gods, you defeat tyrants.	0
tell me what my part is, and then proceed.	0
heaven me send such usage ,  not to pick bad from bad ,  but to change my ways by bad !	0
honest to god ,  where’s the sexton ?	0
well ,  i recognize this one  good god !	0
the one i'll slay, the other slayeth me.	0
o, how may i call this a lightening?	0
maybe i should ask you what right you have to take me ,  but i’ll take you ,  orlando ,  to be my husband .	0
oh no ,  good cassio !	0
come on ,  get ready .	0
i would not for the wealth of all the town do him disrespect here in my house .	0
tell him his pranks have been too excessive to put up with ,  and that your grace has taken a lot of heat because of him .	0
caesar speaks .	0
tell us how it happened ,  gentle casca .	0
a mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.	0
the concernancy ,  sir ?	0
but ,  break my heart ,  for i must be silent !	0
what ,  go you toward the tower ?	0
claribel.	0
you’re torturing me ,  tubal .	0
then ,  masters ,  look to see a troublous world .	0
for my own part ,  i’ll be glad to learn from more capable men .	0
he weeps for what is done .	0
nothing .	0
besides ,  in mercy ,  the constable desires thee thou wilt mind thy followers of repentance ,  that their souls may make a peaceful and a sweet retire from off these fields where ,  wretches ,  their poor bodies must lie and fester .	0
but isn’t there a sequel that follows this mother's surprise ?	0
i held the sword and he ran on it .	0
he’s awfully proud ,  but his pride suits him .	0
the valiant never taste of death but once .	0
why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly ?	0
it is the very error of the moon; she comes more nearer earth than she was wont and makes men mad .	0
at least two hours past that.	0
and this may help to support other proofs that look questionable.	0
yours evermore ,  most dear lady ,  while this brain is in him ,  hamlet .	0
i know not ,  sir .	0
it is locked in my memory ,  and you yourself shall keep the key of it .	0
sirs ,  i will practice on this drunken man .	0
a gallant curtal - axe upon my thigh ,  a boar - spear in my hand ,  and in my heart lie there what hidden woman’s fear there will ,  we’ll have a swashing and a martial outside— as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances .	0
this is no mortal business ,  nor no sound that the earth owes . —i hear it now above me .	0
where should they come ?	0
what !	0
even if it’s not better ,  your first marriage is over .	0
o honey nurse ,  what news ?	0
look ,  and thou shalt see .	0
beware of march 15th .	0
tis a good dullness ,  and give it way .	0
pray you, lead on.	0
ay ,  marry ,  what is he ?	0
caliban !	0
before you can say ,   “ come ”  and  “ go ,  ”  and breathe twice ,  and cry  “ so ,  so ,  ”  each one ,  tripping on his toe ,  will be here with tricks and pranks .	0
this works out better than i could have planned.	0
madam ,  not yet .	0
i'll make no more mothers for fish; or fetch in firing wood when asked to, or scrape dishes, or wash dishes; 'ban 'ban, ca—caliban, has a new master—get a new man.	0
what does she want ?	0
you ask me why i would rather choose to have a weight of dead flesh than to receive three thousand dollars .	0
in genoa ?	0
so the candle went out and now we’re all in the dark .	0
marry ,  that ‘marry’ is the very theme i came to talk of .	0
but if she can’t love you ,  sir ?	0
what do you mean ?	0
the only reason they don’t get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it ,  too .	0
the young rooster.	0
i have brought him a present .	0
if you remember your life before you came here ,  you may also remember how you got here .	0
for if she be not honest, chaste, and true, there's no man happy; the purest of their wives is foul as slander.	0
you shall not in your funeral speech blame us ,  but speak all good you can devise of caesar ,  and say you do ’t by our permission .	0
say no more against it.	0
madam, with all my heart, i shall obey you in all fair commands.	0
ho!	0
wrinkles forbid !	0
good .	0
i didn’t ,  my lord .	0
all lost !	0
ah ,  let be ,  let be !	0
and what an excellent piece of work it is ,  too ,  madam lady !	0
tedious and brief !	0
man doesn’t delight me, no, nor woman either, though by your smiling, you seem to find that funny.	0
tis truly so .	0
and it is marvel he out - dwells his hour ,  for lovers ever run before the clock .	0
no .	0
from forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star - crossed lovers take their life ,  whose misadventured piteous overthrows doth with their death bury their parents' strife .	0
excuse me ,  sir ,  do you know anything about this ?	0
yes, you have seen cassio and she together.	0
hold ,  take these keys and fetch more spices ,  nurse .	0
he drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .	0
well may you prosper .	0
the duke himself, or any of my brothers of the state, cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own; for if such actions may have passage free, bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.	0
sweet doctor ,  you shall be my lover: when i am absent ,  then you can lie with my wife .	0
he started one poor heart of mine in thee .	0
is he not jealous ?	0
what ,  man !	0
where are you ?	0
twas a rough night .	0
but don’t be too tame either ,  but let your own discretion be your teacher .	0
what, ho!	0
i drink this vial to you.	0
he should imprison the person who named you ,  instead .	0
villain am i none .	0
most lamentable day ,  most woeful day that ever ,  ever ,  i have seen !	0
have faith ,  love me ,  and you will get better .	0
this shall forbid it .	0
no ,  it begins again .	0
impatient of my absence, and grief that young octavius with mark antony have made themselves so strong: for with her death that tidings came: with this she fell distract, and, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.	0
how is ’t ,  laertes ?	0
good night .	0
stay warm .	0
oh ,  antony ,  you extravagantly generous man ,  how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold !	0
really, my lord, i would not.	0
yield ,  or thou diest .	0
yea ,  a daniel !	0
you would be satisfied?	0
just as the ox has his yoke ,  the horse its bridle ,  the falcon a tether ,  a man has his desires—to keep in check .	0
aboard, aboard, for shame!	0
alas ,  how is't with you ,  that you do bend your eye on vacancy ,  and with the incorporal air do hold discourse ?	0
let us to the field .	0
i thank you.	0
now that the wind is favorable ,  let’s board the ship .	0
not from crying .	0
there's no trust ,  no faith ,  no honesty in men; all are liars ,  all swear falsely ,  all nothing ,  all deceivers .	0
approach, rich ceres, her to entertain.	0
now do i see 'tis true.	0
yes ,  my good lord .	0
shake it off.	0
come on !	0
to antonio] as many [to adrian] that our garments ,  being ,  as they were ,  [to adrian] that our garments ,  being ,  as they were ,  drenched in the sea ,  hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses ,  being rather new - dyed than stained with salt water .	0
if you’re not immortal, look around you.	0
god help claudio !	0
so much for him !	0
but you didn’t ,  even though you had every reason .	0
this is the monkey's own rumor.	0
we must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable antony’s attention away from that egyptian widow .	0
i shall have glory by this losing day ,  more than octavius and mark antony by this vile conquest shall attain unto .	0
mass ,  and my elbow itched ,  i thought there would a scab follow .	0
myself have letters of the selfsame tenor .	0
i wish i knew what was in your heart .	0
o ,  let me think on hastings and be gone to brecknock ,  while my fearful head is on !	0
romeo he cries aloud, ‘hold, friends!	0
believe me ,  no; i thank my fortune for it ,  my cargos are not all loaded on one ship ,  or going to one place ,  and my whole estate is not based on the fortune of this present year; so ,  my shipments don’t make me sad .	0
the fat ,  sloppy woman cries .	0
nay, answer me.	0
sir, don’t grieve; you are welcome nevertheless.	0
her vestal livery is but sick and green ,  and none but fools do wear it .	0
that very time i saw (but thou couldst not) flying between the cold moon and the earth ,  cupid all armed .	0
this admiration ,  sir ,  is much o' th' savor of other your new pranks .	0
go ,  get thee hence ,  for i will not away .	0
i could not forget you ,  since i never saw you before in my life .	0
content with hermia ?	0
doesn’t she count her blessings that unworthy as she is, we have secured so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?	0
alas, what cry is that?	0
and what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love—as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death .	0
they shouted three times.	0
my own flesh and blood to rebel !	0
they say he has been fencer to the sophy .	0
romeo slew tybalt; romeo must not live .	0
there's a french salutation to your french slop.	0
blessed my foot !	0
if i dream not ,  thou art emilia .	0
sir ,  there was a kind of fighting in my heart that wouldn’t let me sleep .	0
yes ,  certainly ,  and out of doubt and out of question ,  too ,  and ambiguities .	0
ha!	0
but if you remember ,  i didn’t tell you to parody the style .	0
why did you so cry out ,  sirs ,  in your sleep ?	0
never trust me again if i don’t .	0
did you notice how the queen’s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about clarence’s death ?	0
if you tickle us, do we not laugh?	0
i believe drink gave thee the lie last night .	0
take it ,  brave york .	0
but if thou ,  jealous ,  dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do ,  by heaven ,  i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs .	0
diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved, or not at all.	0
for the heavens ,  rouse up a brave mind ,  ”  says the fiend ,   “ and run .  ”  well ,  my conscience ,  hanging about the neck of my heart ,  says very wisely to me ,   “ my honest friend launcelot ,  being an honest man’s son ” —or rather an honest woman’s son ,  for indeed my father did something smack ,  something grow to .	0
i will not.	0
they met me on the day we won the battle, and i have learned by the most perfect report that they have more in them than mortal knowledge.	0
the sun for sorrow will not show his head.	0
don’t forget .	0
ah, where's my man?	0
i never heard such gallant scolding; because, besides the groves, the skies, the fountains, every region near seemed to have one mutual cry.	0
alas ,  who knows ?	0
how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ?	0
well, i will hie and so bestow these papers as you bade me.	0
you’re up early .	0
the best way to be happy is to be in between .	0
look upon caesar .	0
the foul plan backfired on me .	0
get going already .	0
you want proof ?	0
but come, young waverer, come go with me.	0
please don’t cry .	0
how is it ,  general ?	0
let me see the count.	0
the moon goes down at twelve .	0
i cannot make you what amends i would; therefore accept such kindness as i can .	0
those of his chamber ,  as it seemed ,  had done ’t .	0
in the meantime ,  let me be that i am ,  and seek not to alter me .	0
it wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything i’ve seen and heard .	0
admired miranda !	0
and your stories have egged the murder on.	0
this land will belong to your and albany’s children forever . —and now what does my second daughter regan ,  the wife of cornwall ,  have to say ?	0
tis better as it is .	0
or else she could not have the wit to do this .	0
where is she?	0
i will be hanged else !	0
up ,  sword ,  and know thou a more horrid hent .	0
no, my heart is turned to stone; i hit it, and it hurts my hand.	0
he’s a conspirator .	0
why, how are you, general!	0
therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena.	0
please ,  be my god .	0
truly ,  i think they are .	0
i was engaged to her before i ever met hermia .	0
but i am very sorry ,  good horatio ,  that to laertes i forgot myself ,  for by the image of my cause i see the portraiture of his .	0
that i can keep your counsel ,  and not mine own .	0
is your news good or bad?	0
now gods that we adore ,  whereof comes this ?	0
what ,  if i had said i had seen him do you wrong ?	0
that same villain ,  romeo .	0
and that distill'd by magic sleights shall raise such artificial sprites as by the strength of their illusion shall draw him on to his confusion.	0
i remember him well ,  and i remember him worthy of your praise .	0
that’s for sure .	0
are not those in commission yet return'd ?	0
your father !	0
i hope to god he keeps his promise !	0
go ,  tubal ,  and meet me at our synagogue; go ,  good tubal; at our synagogue ,  tubal .	0
do it .	0
shall i entreat a word?	0
uncle ,  i must come forth .	0
this health to lepidus !	0
thou hadst ,  and more ,  miranda .	0
madam, good night.	0
the outcome was doubtful; men fought like tired swimmers who cling together and wind up choking .	0
he ,  upon some action ,  is now in durance at malvolio’s suit ,  a gentleman and follower of my lady’s .	0
for the love of god ,  help us !	0
noble words ,  sir .	0
do it well ,  and then leave us .	0
why ,  true ,  he means to make a puppet of thee .	0
it’s been longer ,  it’s been longer .	0
they murder caesar !  ” —who’s within ?	0
set him free .	0
don’t be afraid of that .	0
i did it myself .	0
tell me ,  you monster ,  where is my son lucentio ?	0
who’s there ?	0
well, juliet, i’ll sleep with you tonight.	0
with what addition ?	0
that will never be .	0
i am thy father’s spirit ,  doomed for a certain term to walk the night and for the day confined to fast in fires ,  till the foul crimes done in my days of nature are burnt and purged away .	0
follow me, then, to a clear place.	0
right now ,  my pressing business calls me away .	0
if it were done when ’tis done ,  then ’twere well it were done quickly .	0
no ,  not so ,  villain ,  thou beliest thyself .	0
poor ropes, you are deceived, both you and i; for romeo is exiled.	0
now, you know how i love you has been proven to you, and as my love is cannot be measured, so is my fear.	0
for women are as roses ,  whose fair flower being once displayed ,  doth fall that very hour .	0
fathers ,  from hence trust not your daughters' minds by what you see them act .	0
a sweet woman !	0
but sir ,  he’s crazy .	0
hear all, all see, and like her most whose merit most shall be; which, amongst view of many, mine, being one, may stand in number, though in reck'ning none.	0
let me shun that .	0
well ,  you temporize with the hours .	0
they are loves i bear to you.	0
i was engaged to her, my lord, before i saw hermia.	0
no, that doesn’t follow.	0
if he will grant me conquered egypt ,  so that i may give it to my son ,  i will kneel to him with thanks .	0
so go .	0
what doth this mean ,  my lord ?	0
if we do meet again, why, we shall smile; if not, why then this parting was well made.	0
now, where it is beastly forgetfulness, or some defeated principle of thinking too much on the event, a thought which, cut in quarters, has but one part wisdom and always three parts coward, i don’t know why i am still live to say “this thing's to do, “ since i have cause, and will, and strength, and means to do it.	0
i love to cope him in these sullen fits ,  for then he’s full of matter .	0
why ?	0
caesar and antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person .	0
then ,  i’ll attack you with my wit !	0
it’s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .	0
o ,  throw away the worser part of it ,  and live the purer with the other half ,  good night—but go not to my uncle's bed .	0
provoke not battle till we have done at sea .	0
farewell .	0
do what you want to do, because i’m finished with you.	0
what do you say, my lord?	0
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nurs'd .	0
oh ,  bottom ,  you’ve changed !	0
am i not wise ?	0
let me see one.	0
portia, forgive me this forced wrong; and in the hearing of these many friends, i swear to you, even by your own beautiful eyes, that i see myself in,— listen, only that!	0
well ,  well ,  well .	0
then let them use us well ,  else let them know ,  the ills we do ,  their ills instruct us so .	0
what may i call your name ?	0
i’d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother’s garden .	0
judge me ,  you gods !	0
a second time i kill my husband dead when second husband kisses me in bed.	0
i heard thee speak me a speech once ,  but it was never acted; or if it was ,  not above once; for the play ,  i remember ,  pleased not the million ,  'twas caviary to the general; but it was—as i received it ,  and others ,  whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play ,  well digested in the scenes ,  set down with as much mod -  esty as cunning .	0
and i am such a tender ass ,  if my hair do but tickle me ,  i must scratch .	0
she was here even now .	0
are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?	0
i’ll do that ,  because i have to tell my brother how you forgave him ,  rosalind .	0
have by some surgeon ,  shylock ,  on your charge ,  to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death .	0
caesar ,  it’s eight o'clock .	0
then it looks like macbeth will become king .	0
i believe that this applause is for some new honors that are to be heaped on caesar.	0
very obedient—keep crying . —concerning this—oh ,  what fake emotion ! —i am being ordered home—get away from me ,  i’ll send for you later . —sir ,  i’ll obey the order and return to venice .	0
i have a head, sir, that will find out logs and never trouble peter for the matter.	0
you think it’s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .	0
the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance; but much more that spirit upon whose weal depends and rests the lives of many.	0
put your sword away, or use it to help me break up this fight.	0
you are a lover; borrow cupid's wings ,  and use them to soar above that leaden soul .	0
master malvolio ?	0
no trouble ,  sir .	0
moth!	0
wife ,  we were just thinking ourselves blessed that god had given us this only child ,  but now i see that this one is one too many ,  and that we are cursed in having her .	0
i will then give it you soundly.	0
tis twenty year till then .	0
but by and by comes back to romeo ,  who had but newly entertained revenge ,  and to ’t they go like lightning ,  for ere i could draw to part them was stout tybalt slain .	0
there, give it to your whore.	0
what man art thou that ,  thus bescreened in night ,  so stumblest on my counsel ?	0
thou look’st like him that knows a warlike charge .	0
my words are as full of peace as matter .	0
i am a fellow o' th' strangest mind i' th' world .	0
this is getting worse and worse !	0
but i smile at swords, laugh scornfully at weapons, brandished by man that's been given birth by a woman.	0
are my deserts no better?	0
where’s dolabella ?	0
thither he will come to know his destiny .	0
it does ,  my lord .	0
pull them apart .	0
i think you’re all either bewildered or stark raving mad .	0
three thousand dollars, for three months, and antonio obligated.	0
art thou his friend ?	0
in every one of the lords' households i have a servant paid to spy for me .	0
i'll fall down flat; maybe he won’t notice me.	0
do it ,  and shout like the city’s on fire .	0
o ,  treachery !	0
let’s do this legally.	0
o my lord ,  my lord ,  forgive my fearful sails !	0
silvius ,  keep your promise to marry phoebe if she refuses me .	0
remember the reward we’re getting when the deed’s done .	0
all this?	0
they’ll kill us !	0
i think it is the weakness of mine eyes that shapes this monstrous apparition .	0
now i arise .	0
you'd be king o's the isle, sirrah?	0
come hither.	0
laertes ,  i want you to hear what they say .	0
well.	0
there’s another garment for ’t .	0
i’ll cross it ,  though it kill me .	0
but ,  sir— why should you do this ,  you want to know ?	0
why, then the devil give him good of it!	0
and yet to me what is this quintessence of dust ?	0
what is her mother ?	0
it will heal and be as good as new ,  and we’ll be threatened by its fangs once again .	0
these times of woe afford no time to woo .	0
the prince will sentence you to death if you are taken prisoner .	0
o, these outbursts and jerky shaking, impostors of true fear, would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire, confirmed by her grandmother.	0
a gentle scroll .	0
and there assume some other horrible form ,  which might deprive your sovereignty of reason and draw you into madness ?	0
i can’t sleep quietly in the tower .	0
at mine own house ,  good lady .	0
my lord bassanio, let him have the ring: let what he deserves, and with my friendship, be measured against your wife's commandment.	0
was ever match clapped up so suddenly ?	0
this is some priory .	0
it is enacted in the laws of venice,— if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen, the party 'gainst the which he doth contrive, shall seize one half his goods; the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state; and the offender's life lies in the mercy of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.	0
in such a night pretty jessica, like a little witch, lied about her love, and he forgave her.	0
let me see them .	0
indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.	0
o ,  he is mad ,  laertes .	0
the dead man's knell is there scarce ask'd for who ,  and good men's lives expire before the flowers in their caps ,  dying or ere they sicken .	0
but where’s my fool ?	0
her speech is nothing ,  yet the unshaped use of it doth move the hearers to collection; they aim at it ,  and botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; which ,  as her winks and nods and gestures yield them ,  indeed would make one think there might be thought ,  though nothing sure ,  yet much unhappily .	0
marry ,  my uncle clarence' angry ghost .	0
agree to swear .	0
farewell, cicero.	0
i was sure your lordship did not give it me .	0
peace !	0
caesar, i never believed in omens, yet now they frighten me.	0
sweetly in force unto her fair life’s end .	0
i don’t know from what part of the world i should be contacted, if not by lord hamlet.	0
she speaks my language !	0
what ,  man ,  there are ways to recover the general again .	0
o my fair warrior!	0
where is she ?	0
for heaven’s sake ,  stop this savage brawl !	0
ay, casca, tell us what hath chanced today, that caesar looks so sad.	0
i think of as many matters as he ,  but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .	0
father, what news?	0
the  get out of here !	0
i’ll find you another horse .	0
and look where publius is coming to go get me.	0
some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .	0
it’s a trick to confuse us .	0
if you tickle us ,  do we not laugh ?	0
what if i had a rat in my house ,  and i felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?	0
o ,  they did urge it still unto the king .	0
said he not so ?	0
i shall ,  my lord .	0
can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?	0
you don’t know my voice ?	0
i do: and surely it is a sleepy language, and you talk in your sleep.	0
most noble empress ,  you have heard of me ?	0
there is some grudge between them; it’s not proper that they are alone .	0
and long live you to think so !	0
the fault of it i’ll answer .	0
worthy montano, you were wont be civil; the gravity and stillness of your youth the world hath noted, and your name is great in mouths of wisest censure.	0
go ,  one of you ,  find out the forester .	0
for this relief much thanks .	0
hum !	0
no .	0
within this hour ,  my man shall be with you ,  and bring you a rope ladder; which must be my way to the highest point of my joy in the secret night .	0
but i swear i’m not the person i’m playing .	0
i am not drunk now; i can stand well enough, and i speak well enough.	0
a very handsome man.	0
if there are any ,  speak ,  for it is he whom i have offended .	0
take him up gently ,  and to bed with him ,  and each one to his office when he wakes .	0
do you know me ?	0
i have undone three tailors .	0
o, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!	0
yes ,  sir ,  for three months .	0
to alonso] it is foul weather in us all ,  good sir ,  [to alonso] it is foul weather in us all ,  good sir ,  when you are cloudy .	0
the letters he spoke of may help me .	0
what?	0
my lord ,  we will not .	0
i am informèd thoroughly of the cause .	0
but how is it that this memory lives in your mind?	0
twill be recorded for a precedent ,  and many an error by the same example will rush into the state .	0
o, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!	0
the date is out of such prolixity.	0
hear all ,  all see ,  and like her most whose merit most shall be; which ,  amongst view of many ,  mine ,  being one ,  may stand in number ,  though in reck'ning none .	0
only describing what you have ruined .	0
she’s not even fourteen years old .	0
nature has made it so that i can see through your chest all the way to your heart .	0
shall i have the thought to think on this; and shall i lack the thought that such a thing, bechanc'd, would make me sad?	0
as for your desire to know what happened between us ,  control it the best you can .	0
get more candles; wake up all my relatives .	0
but let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer, ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep in the affliction of these terrible dreams that shake us nightly.	0
can you inquire him out and be edified by report ?	0
down, strumpet!	0
and can you by no drift of conference get from him why he puts on this confusion ,  grating so harshly all his days of quiet with turbulent and dangerous lunacy ?	0
then you can direct me to him you delivered them for .	0
well then ,  leave them alone until they’re sober .	0
but antonio is certainly undone.	0
i wish i had !	0
you speak well .	0
marry ,  will i ,  sir .	0
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o'er ere love be done!	0
how is it that moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover ?	0
come on ,  my dear greek philosopher .	0
thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.	0
i’m already here ,  sir .	0
what man is there so much unreasonable ,  if you had pleas'd to have defended it with any terms of zeal ,  wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony ?	0
are they still followed ?	0
and i for no woman .	0
no, i know not.	0
yes ,  they are .	0
i humbly thank you ,  sir .	0
my father’s spirit is growing in me ,  and i won’t take this any longer .	0
he carries himself like a dignified gentleman ,  and ,  to tell you the truth ,  he has a reputation throughout verona as a virtuous and well - behaved young man .	0
but speak you this with a sad brow ?	0
give me your hand, and take my magic cloak from me.—so: lie there my magic.—wipe your eyes; have comfort.	0
if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her ,  and bring her along with you ,  it may awake my bounty further .	0
were they not forced with those that should be ours ,  we might have met them dareful ,  beard to beard ,  and beat them backward home .	0
you will lose this wager ,  my lord .	0
ay ,  my good lord .	0
your children shall be kings.	0
i lent my body once to make him rich .	0
turn back ,  dull earth ,  and find thy centre out .	0
there's comfort in that .	0
and to sink in it ,  should you burthen love— too great oppression for a tender thing .	0
shame itself!	0
world ,  world ,  o world !	0
i’m not staying here to argue anymore .	0
albeit you have deserved high commendation ,  true applause ,  and love ,  yet such is now the duke’s condition that he misconsters all that you have done .	0
how have i offended ?	0
young romeo is it?	0
and shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was ready to fly; and then it is the nature of them all to leave the nest.	0
alack ,  what heinous sin is it in me to be ashamed to be my father’s child !	0
that's the end.	0
come on!	0
there is an old poor man who after me hath many a weary step limped in pure love .	0
i didn’t see him .	0
but if he had not been in drink ,  he would have tickled you othergates than he did .	0
give me mine armor.	0
the life ”  ?	0
how now ,  general ?	0
i'll see it done.	0
let me go ,  sir ,  or i’ll knock you o'er the mazzard .	0
i'll touch my point with this contagion, that, if i gall him slightly, it may be death.	0
if he offers to choose, and chooses the right chest, you would be refusing to perform your father's will, if you refused to accept him.	0
beware macduff; beware the baron of fife.	0
bid her come hither .	0
scurvy knave !	0
what is the prince's doom ?	0
will you hear me ,  roderigo ?	0
i wasn’t expecting you ,  and i’m not ready to receive you .	0
humours!	0
you’re smart ,  though ,  and if you were sick ,  you’d take what you needed to get better .	0
if you can think of any crime not yet confessed to heaven and grace, do it right away.	0
farewell ,  ophelia ,  and remember well what i have said to you .	0
ha ,  ha ,  ha !	0
what would your gracious figure?	0
or should we enter without apologizing ?	0
ho ,  awake !	0
i charge thee ,  hence ,  and do not haunt me thus .	0
what’s your grace’s will ?	0
long stayed he so .	0
tell what you are .	0
for me ,  with sorrow i embrace my fortune .	0
phoebe ,  with all my heart .	0
good my lord ,  how does your honor for this many a day ?	0
tis one iago ,  ancient to the general .	0
in thy foul throat thou liest .	0
how comes it?	0
she should have died hereafter .	0
i hope you’re strong enough to do it .	0
how heavy weighs my lord !	0
what ,  shall i find you here ?	0
who is so firm, so constant, that this noisy disturbance would not infect his sanity?	0
longer, longer.	0
if that the earth could teem with woman's tears, each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.	0
will you go ?	0
i have such deadly drugs ,  but mantua's law gives the death penalty to anybody who sells them .	0
is not ,  sir ,  my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it ?	0
as willingly as e'er i came from school .	0
it stands by her bedside .	0
there ,  my lord .	0
i would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .	0
if she were so moral ,  she would never have fallen in love with the moor in the first place .	0
be convincing .	0
it is written that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ.	0
it hangs like an old worn - out mop .	0
but what’s your trade ?	0
ay, madam, it is common.	0
o, i were damn'd beneath all depth in hell, but that i did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity.	0
this was a venture ,  sir ,  that jacob served for— a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayed and fashioned by the hand of heaven .	0
grim death ,  how foul and loathsome is thine image !	0
my leisure serves me ,  pensive daughter ,  now . — my lord ,  we must entreat the time alone .	0
there was a time when you’d freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless i said them ,  that objects never pleased your eye unless i showed them to you ,  that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches ,  and that food never tasted sweet to you unless i had prepared it .	0
fare you well .	0
oh ,  that’s nonsense !	0
i hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest i feel in my heart .	0
but if you steal my reputation ,  you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer ,  but makes me much poorer .	0
by heaven, i love you better than i love myself, because i came here only armed against myself.	0
how are you, ophelia!	0
bernardo?	0
so ,  go; these griefs and losses have so upset me that i shall hardly have a pound of flesh tomorrow give to my bloody creditor .	0
his secret-keeping, i am sure, cannot carry his courage, because the goose cannot carry the fox.	0
what ,  with worms and flies ?	0
i’m not a man who talks a lot ,  but i thank you .	0
listen !	0
bring a conclusion, rather than need a spirit: appear, and quickly.	0
who ,  he ?	0
aside.	0
and he’s rubbed himself with perfume .	0
aside] poor worm!	0
so she may live unscarred of bleeding slaughter ,  i will confess she was not edward’s daughter .	0
farewell.	0
fear comes upon me .	0
what should i do?	0
dead ,  dead ?	0
that’s completely beside the point .	0
did you notice ?	0
i learned it in england ,  where they have a talent for drinking .	0
this is as strange a maze as e'er men trod ,  and there is in this business more than nature was ever conduct of .	0
more knocking: get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us and show us to be watchers.	0
how canst thou try them so ?	0
what noise ?	0
i am armed and well prepared . — give me your hand ,  bassanio .	0
now go to the door and stay there till we call .	0
i will do so .	0
a man may fish with the worm that has eaten a king ,  and eat the fish that has fed on that worm .	0
they would be better, if well followed.	0
then i must be thy lady; but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land ,  and in the shape of corin sat all day ,  playing on pipes of corn ,  and versing love to amorous phillida .	0
i long to hear the story of your life, which must affect the ear strangely.	0
i asked you for certain sums of gold ,  which you denied me;— because i cannot raise any money by dirty means .	0
stop the play .	0
with whom?	0
portia is dead .	0
you look angerly.	0
an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek ,  a goodly apple rotten at the heart .	0
pray you ,  sir ,  do you know of this matter ?	0
i grant i am a woman ,  but withal a woman well reputed ,  cato's daughter .	0
i didn’t .	0
pregnancy is a blessing, but not as your daughter may get pregnant.	0
and nothing in your letters was written about her?	0
i believe that this applause is for some new honors that are to be heaped on caesar .	0
both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command ,  instead of asking us so politely .	0
nurse, will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?	0
fiery ”  ?	0
a sweet woman!	0
don’t misunderstand me ,  sir .	0
you have dancing shoes with nimble soles; i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move.	0
seneca cannot be too heavy ,  nor plautus too light .	0
nay ,  an you will not ,  sir ,  i’ll take my heels .	0
the king and queen and all are coming down .	0
whither should i fly ?	0
where should they be set else ?	0
are you picking a fight with us, sir?	0
but in my conscience ,  sir ,  i do not care for you .	0
sir?	0
fly ,  masters !	0
o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!	0
i did so ,  and take heed on ’t ,  make it a darling like your precious eye .	0
here ,  my good lord .	0
now all the blessings of a glad father compass thee about !	0
if i can hide my face, let me play thisbe too.	0
has anyone offended your worship ?	0
sir, for your hurts, i myself will be your surgeon.	0
i should not then ask casca what had chanced .	0
caesar greets the queen of egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .	0
if you look closely at alexander’s life ,  harry of monmouth’s stands up fairly well by comparison—for there are analogies in everything .	0
ay, with a twink.	0
let me see:  “ who chooses me shall gain what many men desire .  ”  what many men desire !	0
i have no choice .	0
you gave us the slip ,  sir ,  the slip .	0
what need one ?	0

when laban and he agreed that all the lambs which were streaked and multicolored should be given to jacob, the ewes, being divided, were bred with the rams at the end of autumn; and just when the rams and the ewes were in the act of procreation, the skilful shepherd peeled certain sticks, and, at the moment of mating, he stuck them up before the fat ewes, who, then conceiving, did in lambing time gave birth to multicolored lambs, and those were jacob's.	0

i hope that we may ,  but my heart is still very much afraid of him ,  and my gut feeling is that he cannot be trusted .	0

he called me sebastian .	0
i hope we have reformed that indifferently with us ,  sir .	0

here ,  catch this chest; it is worth the trouble .	0
who is ’t that can inform me ?	0
he is very well - favored ,  and he speaks very shrewishly .	0
how is it now!	0

where is the horse that retraces his boring steps again with the same fire that he walked them in the first place ?	0

or did i dream it so ?	0
i’ll none of it .	0

o love ,  be moderate .	0
please ,  go on .	0
no ,  let's come in !	0
he’ll do whatever hastings does .	0
you bastard workhorse drudge !	0
what kind of game is this ?	0
well then ,  if i’ve ever thanked a man ,  i’ll thank you now .	0
when i burned in desire to question them further ,  they made themselves air ,  into which they vanished .	0
the doors are broken.	0
withdraw; i hear him coming.	0
but how ?	0
my mind hath been as big as one of yours ,  my heart as great ,  my reason haply more ,  to bandy word for word and frown for frown .	0
i came to venice with a number of antonio’s creditors who say he won’t be able to avoid going bankrupt .	0
what will i do ,  do you think ?	0
no more of that .	0
nothing ,  except your true love for my lord .	0

first ,  good peter quince ,  say what the play treats on; then read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point .	0
henceforward do your messages yourself.	0
i thank you ,  valiant cassio .	0
if thou more murmur'st ,  i will rend an oak ,  and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howled away twelve winters .	0
most noble brother ,  you have done me wrong .	0
that now sweno ,  the norways’ king ,  craves composition; nor would we deign him burial of his men till he disbursed ,  at saint colme's inch ,  ten thousand dollars to our general use .	0
but let me hear the letter of your friend.	0
in truth ,  you are to blame .	0
over hill, over dale, thorough bush, thorough brier, over park, over pale, thorough flood, thorough fire, i do wander every where, swifter than the moon's sphere; and i serve the fairy queen, to dew her orbs upon the green.	0
romeo, good night.	0
while i waited ,  i’d frown impatiently ,  and perhaps wind my watch ,  or play with my—with some expensive piece of jewelry i happen to be wearing .	0
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water ?	0
swear priests and cowards ,  and deceitful men ,  old feeble dead bodies and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs; swear to bad causes that such creatures as men doubt ,  but don’t stain the even goodness of our undertaking ,  or the unsuppressed character of our spirits ,  to think that our cause and our performance need oaths ,  when every drop of blood that every roman carries ,  and carries nobly ,  is guilty of causing the birth of several bastards ,  if he breaks the smallest particle of any promise that he has made .	0
for his thoughts ,  would they were blanks ,  rather than fill’d with me .	0
since macbeth went to war ,  i have seen her rise from her bed ,  put on her nightgown ,  unlock her closet ,  take out some paper ,  fold it ,  write on it ,  read it ,  seal it up ,  and then return to bed ,  remaining asleep the entire time .	0
i find here that don pedro hath bestowed much honor on a young florentine called claudio .	0
i was afraid this would happen ,  because he was a noble ,  brave man ,  but i didn’t think he had a weapon .	0
thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life .	0
awake !	0
give you good night .	0
i hoped you would have been my hamlet's wife, i thought to have decorated your bride-bed, sweet maid, and not your grave.	0
that would hang us ,  every mother's son .	0
i was about to protest i loved you .	0
answer to that .	0

give me thy torch ,  boy .	0
fore god, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.	0
why do you come here ?	0
why ,  he drinks you with facility your dane dead drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your almain .	0
give a quick example .	0
seven days and nights?	0
here’s a goat for you .	0
who is ’t you mean ?	0
o hamlet, what a falling-off there was in our marriage!	0
tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .	0
don’t follow; i won’t put up with your speaking; i’ll have my promise to pay .	0
i promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now .	0
amen .	0
stand far off .	0
one–two— why then ’tis time to do't .	0
what does she need?	0
he is ready at the door .	0
what music should we play then ?	0
ay ,  my lord .	0
it is my will; the which if thou respect ,  show a fair presence and put off these frowns ,  an ill - beseeming semblance for a feast .	0
such ghosts and goblins in my life, that, on my arrival, without any delay, no, not even to wait for the grinding of the axe, my head should be chopped off.	0
what says that fool of hagar's offspring ,  huh ?	0
your love says ,  like an honest gentleman ,  and a courteous ,  and a kind ,  and a handsome ,  and ,  i warrant ,  a virtuous— where is your mother ?	0
i will reward your loyalty .	0
let me work; for i can give his humor the true bent, and i will bring him to the capitol.	0
then ,  lest he may ,  prevent .	0
she said so .	0
that can’t be it ,  since i still have all those things for which i did the murder ,  my crown ,  my own ambition ,  and my queen .	0
go ,  bind this man ,  for he is frantic too .	0
it is not honesty in me to discuss what i have seen and known.	0
why ,  fare thee well .	0
if you were men, as men you are in show, you would not use a gentle lady so: to vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts, when i am sure you hate me with your hearts.	0
where are these hearts ?	0
by my troth ,  i would not undertake her in this company .	0
an the duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing pyramus ,  i’ll be hanged .	0
why ,  she’s inside .	0
thanks ,  rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern .	0
mother, goodnight.	0
this will prove a brave kingdom to me, where i shall have my music for nothing.	0
you’ll force me ,  then ,  to read the will ?	0
it would be as natural to me as it is to you: and i should do it much more easily, because my good will is in it, and yours is against it.	0
cast it off.	0
what, ho!	0
o gentle son ,  sprinkle cool patience on the heat and flame of your anger !	0
the spirit torments me .	0
o any thing ,  of nothing first create !	0
how now ,  sir ?	0
what an enormous thing for us to forget ! —edmund ,  tell us ,  where’s the king ?	0
what a drunken imbecile is this !	0
who is it that cried!	0
but it doesn’t matter.	0
i am your host .	0
he found it then; i never gave it to him.	0
once more remove, good friends.	0

and after this, let caesar sit more securely on his throne, because we will shake him from there, or endure worse days.	0
so i’ve begged him to come along with us to watch what happens this night ,  that ,  if this apparition comes again ,  he may believe what we have seen and speak to it .	0
this might be the head of a politician ,  which this ass now reaches over one that would go around god ,  might it not ?	0

o ,  my old master . —who hath bound him here ?	0
when does another like him come ?	0
beshrew my very heart ,  i think you are happy in this second match ,  for it excels your first .	0
no, by no means.	0
but to the quick o' the ulcer !	0

meet me and gratiano at gratiano’s lodging some hour hence .	0
we'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.	0

i wonder what it means .	0
give me that man that is not passion's slave, and i will wear him in my heart's core, yes, in my heart of heart, as i do you.	0
she awakes .	0
well, i'll point you in the right direction.	0
i am not furnished with the present money .	0
i'll make you quiet; what ! —cheerly ,  my hearts !	0

and there is a forerunner come from a fifth ,  the prince of morocco ,  who brings word the prince his master will be here tonight .	0
you’re in trouble either way .	0
would you mind if we woke up the king ?	0
what it is ,  my caius ,  i’ll tell you ,  as we are walking ,  as to whom it must be done .	0
why i’m going down into this tomb is partly to see my lady's face, but mostly to take a precious ring from her dead finger, a ring that i must use in a very special errand.	0
o me !	0
i am ready for you .	0
help me ,  angels !	0
a lioness hath whelpèd in the streets ,  and graves have yawned and yielded up their dead .	0
while i see living creatures ,  the gashes look better on them .	0
if our play had gone forward, we would’ve all been made men.	0
i don’t want to dance .	0
i saw othello’s visage in his mind ,  and to his honors and his valiant parts did i my soul and fortunes consecrate .	0
the vapors ,  whizzing in the air give off so much light that i can read by them . —  " brutus ,  you sleep .	0
she takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come ,  and ,  on her knee ,  she begged me to stay home today .	0
well, go to, very well.	0
say to the king i would attend his leisure for a few words .	0
tell me ,  good brutus ,  can you see your face ?	0
but ,  my good lord ,  this boy is forest - born and hath been tutored in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle ,  whom he reports to be a great magician obscurèd in the circle of this forest .	0
why ,  how now ,  charmian ?	0
nurse ,  will you go with me to my closet ,  and help me pick out the things you think i will need for tomorrow ?	0
o isis ,  ’tis impossible .	0
o heavenly powers ,  restore him !	0

of what personage and years is he ?	0
are we all here ?	0
come ,  cousin ,  i am sure you love the gentleman .	0
ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.	0
tongue nor heart cannot comprehend or name you !	0
orlando .	0
then will i give you the serving-creature.	0
now old desire doth in his deathbed lie, and young affection gapes to be his heir; that fair for which love groan'd for and would die, with tender juliet match'd, is now not fair.	0
it was armed ,  you say ?	0
near and on speedy foot .	0
my poverty but not my will consents .	0
by inheritance ,  i know i am baron of glamis; only how am i baron of cawdor ?	0
they eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .	0
and in the morn and liquid dew of youth ,  contagious blastments are most imminent .	0
where are they?	0
get it ,  sister .	0
no ,  no ,  he is dead; go to thy deathbed; he never will come again .	0
and so good morrow to you every one .	0
but you’re not listening to me.	0
peace ,  ho !	0
on ,  on ,  you noblest english ,  whose blood is fet from fathers of war - proof ,  fathers that ,  like so many alexanders ,  have in these parts from morn till even fought and sheathed their swords for lack of argument .	0
if i’m not mistaken ,  that’s portia’s voice .	0
our hostess keeps her state ,  but in best time we will require her welcome .	0
but so what ?	0
who can say i’m evil when my advice is so good ?	0
i .	0
is this true?	0
the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me.	0
at last i left them i' th' filthy - mantled pool beyond your cell ,  there dancing up to th' chins ,  that the foul lake o'erstunk their feet .	0
the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me.	0
that's not so good now .	0
this falls out better than i could devise.	0
my more particular ,  and that which most with you should safe my going ,  is fulvia’s death .	0
now ,  by this hand ,  i gave it to a youth , — a kind of boy; a little scrubbed boy ,  no higher than thyself ,  the judge's clerk; a prating boy ,  that begg'd it as a fee; i could not for my heart deny it him .	0
who are you ,  coming so fast in this quiet night ?	0
it will be our fault ,  who should’ve kept this mad young man on a short leash ,  restrained ,  and out of society .	0
well ,  to my choice:  “ who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves .  ”  i will assume i am deserving .	0
can he that deny ?	0
confess yourself freely to her ,  importune her help to put you in your place again .	0
ambassadors from harry king of england do crave admittance to your majesty .	0
it is an unweeded garden that is going to seed, only things that are decaying and disgusting grow there.	0
it’s my exercise time .	0
ay ,  so i thought .	0
o noble caesar!	0
so thou ,  that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee ,  with urging helpless patience would relieve me; but ,  if thou live to see like right bereft ,  this fool - begged patience in thee will be left .	0
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day’s journey ,  and from nine till twelve is three long hours ,  yet she is not come .	0
whereby hangs a tale ,  sir ?	0
the very same .	0
to - morrow will i send .	0
i hear him near.	0
as for your desire to know what happened between us, control it the best you can.	0
and she’s fierce ,  even though she’s little .	0
stop ,  for god’s sake !	0
the measure done ,  i'll watch her place of stand and ,  touching hers ,  make blessed my rude hand .	0
i’m done .	0
of albany’s and cornwall’s powers you heard not ?	0
go home ,  be merry ,  give consent to marry paris .	0
i will not trouble you as yet to question you about your fortunes . — give us some music ,  and ,  good cousin ,  sing .	0
five shillings to one on ’t ,  with any man that knows the statutes ,  he may stay him—marry ,  not without the prince be willing ,  for indeed the watch ought to offend no man ,  and it is an offense to stay a man against his will .	0
stand and unfold yourself.	0
look ,  he’s moving .	0
now ,  good metellus ,  go along by him .	0
i have already .	0
where’s your master ,  dromio ?	0
the bud from the moon-goddess’ plant has such force and blessed power over cupid's flower.	0
come hither ,  fabian .	0
know you before whom ,  sir ?	0
how many ,  as you guess ?	0
my noble lords and cousins all ,  good morrow .	0
and let us swear our resolution .	0
music ,  listen !	0
alas the day, i never gave him cause!	0

good job ,  my little one .	0
she’s an excellent sweet lady ,  and ,  out of all suspicion ,  she is virtuous .	0
how are you ,  my love ? —demetrius and egeus ,  come with us .	0
nay, faith, let not me play a woman; i have a beard coming.	0
but the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor .	0
never alone did the king sigh ,  but with a general groan .	0
what’s up ,  grumio ?	0
or i do forget myself ?	0
a pox o’ your throat, you bawling, blasphemous, incharitable dog!	0
who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves .  ”  and well said too—for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honorable without the stamp of merit ?	0
whither are you going ?	0
your name’s gloucester .	0
throw some of them at me .	0
absolutely not .	0
won’t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?	0
will you stay a while ?	0
if she cannot entreat, i can compel.	0
murder !	0
madam, it is, so you stand pleas'd withal.	0
sir toby belch !	0
i would ,  my boy .	0
what should i do i do not ?	0
he cannot speak ,  my lord .	0
not in the stocks ,  fool .	0
the county will be here with music straight, for so he said he would.	0
sir, there is especial commission come from venice to depute cassio in othello's place.	0
is it e'en so ?	0
yes ,  it’s well built ,  and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced .	0
no thisbe do i see .	0
lie not a night from home .	0
i do not cross you, but i will do so.	0
followed the old man forth .	0
in faith ,  he's penitent; and yet his trespass ,  in our common reason— save that ,  they say ,  the wars must make examples out of their best—is not almost a fault to incur a private check .	0
tell them so ,  decius .	0
i beg you all, if you have kept this sight secret so far, keep your silence still, and whatever else shall happen tonight, take it in, but don’t talk about it.	0
how long is that since?	0
weigh it but with the grossness of this age ,  you break not sanctuary in seizing him .	0
what players are they ?	0
fire !	0
the poor thing ,  he is so shaken with a fever that it’s terrible to see .	0
all of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .	0
stay within .	0
that’s how we’ll do it ,  then .	0
sweetheart ,  goodbye !	0
good pilgrim, you wrong your hand too much, which is showing devotion and good manners in this touch; for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands touch, and putting a palm to another palm is a holy pilgrim's kiss.	0
but out of question ,  ’tis maria’s hand .	0
you’re looking for lord hamlet .	0
at my house .	0
yes ?	0
if my horse doesn’t ride better, i must become a borrower of the night, for a dark hour or two.	0
filth ,  thou liest !	0
that's not the tune .	0
don’t ask me what i know .	0
an honest mind and plain ,  he must speak truth .	0
i am aweary of this moon.	0
relent ,  and save your souls .	0
nay ,  then ,  thou mock’st me .	0
we'll wait for your lordship.	0
see ,  your wife’s with him .	0
hear you me ,  jessica: lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum ,  and the vile squealing of the wry - neck'd fife ,  clamber not you up to the casements then ,  nor thrust your head into the public street ,  to gaze on christian fools with varnish'd faces: but stop my house's ears ,  i mean my casements; let not the sound of shallow foppery enter my sober house . —by jacob's staff i swear ,  i have no mind of feasting forth to - night: but i will go . —go you before me ,  sirrah; say ,  i will come .	0
what do you say to a piece of beef with mustard ?	0
o gentle lady ,  do not put me to't; for i am nothing if not critical .	0
dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of france—i cannot tell wat is  to kiss .	0
how can these things in me seem scorn to you ,  bearing the badge of faith to prove them true ?	0
there are some harsh contents in that letter that steal the color from bassanio's cheeks: some dear friend is dead ,  or nothing else in the world could change the constitution so much of any constant man .	0
against all rules of nature ,  and must be driven to find out practices of cunning hell why this should be .	0
and yon tall anchoring bark ,	0
they’re good enough to drink in ,  and so are these boots .	0
sir paris ,  i will make a desperate tender of my child's love .	0
are you at leisure, holy father, now, or shall i come to you at evening mass?	0
there's something in his soul over which his depression sits like a bird on an egg, and i doubt that egg will hatch and the “bird” will be something dangerous, which to prevent, i have quickly decided to write it down like this.	0
quickly ,  quickly ,  good iras ,  quickly .	0
but who’s here?—lysander!	0
here comes another jew .	0
get you all three into the boxtree .	0
yes, to smell pork; to eat in the temple that your prophet, the nazarene, conjured the devil into.	0
sleep for a week; for the next night, i warrant, the county paris hath set up his rest that you shall rest but little.	0
but thou'rt too much my friend ,  and i’ll not wish thee to her .	0
are you yet living ?	0
your worth is very dear in my regard .	0
my first lie ever was these things i said about myself .	0
i’ve locked it up in my room .	0
be patient ,  gentlemen .	0
i could cure you ,  if you just called me rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me .	0
come down ,  look no more .	0
all i have to do is remove it .	0
come ,  talk not of her .	0
forgive me of my foul murder !	0
that handkerchief which i so loved and gave thee ,  thou gav’st to cassio .	0
romeo ,  good night .	0
the concavities of it is not sufficient ,  for ,  look you ,  th' athversary ,  you may discuss unto the duke ,  look you ,  is digt himself four yard under the countermines .	0
i know the real reason .	0
was my father a traitor ,  mother ?	0
let me see now: to get his place ,  and to plume up my will in double knavery—how ,  how ?	0
your mother .	0
your worm is your only emperor for diet.	0
so ,  you're paid .	0
the folly of this island !	0
all lost!	0
then hurry up and rush over to friar lawrence’s cell .	0
would they had stay'd!	0
if i live through this ,  i’ll be good to you .	0
it is gone, and will not answer us.	0
my dukedom to a beggarly denier ,  i do mistake my person all this while !	0
my husband!	0
i will seize him.	0
sir ,  sir ,  be patient .	0
well ,  whose is it ?	0
i know thy constellation is right apt for this affair .	0
and when the mind is engaged ,  the rest of the body ,  dead and dull before ,  wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity ,  like a snake shedding its dead skin .	0
you cloudy princes and heart - sorrowing peers that bear this heavy mutual load of moan ,  now cheer each other in each other’s love .	0
nay ,  pray be covered .	0
go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately ,  and bring me their interpretation of the results .	0
we will have vengeance for it, don’t worry about that.	0
craziness in great ones must not go unwatched .	0
why ,  what's the matter ?	0
this is one lucianus ,  nephew to the king .	0
god be with you and keep you ,  and may he heal your head .	0
within this three mile may you see it coming; i say ,  a moving grove .	0
well, well; but, as for me, as i have made up my mind to run away, so i’ll not rest until i have run some ground.	0
we are three of them .	0
six o’clock ,  at which time ,  my lord ,  you said our work should end .	0
her speech is nothing, yet the random use of it moves the listeners to collect them, they aim at making sense of it, and mix her words up fit to their own ideas, which, as her winks and nods and gestures as she speaks, would indeed make someone think there might be clear, though nothing for sure, yet very unhappily.	0
no ,  i’m begging you now ,  tell me who it is .	0
when i had at my pleasure taunted her, and she in mild terms begg'd my patience, i then did ask of her her changeling child; which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land.	0
but ,  i beg you ,  don’t let any of your people wake me up; i feel a deep sleep coming .	0
you were the prettiest baby that i ever nursed.	0
young child of treachery!	0
what rhubarb, senna, or other purgative drugs, would do keep these english here healthy?	0
mend the instance ,  shepherd .	0
i don’t know ,  sir .	0
i married them; and their stol'n marriage day was tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city; for whom, and not for tybalt, juliet pin'd.	0
i like this one .	0
i am satisfied in nature ,  whose motive in this case should stir me most to my revenge .	0
give me some wine, fill my cup full.	0
i don’t want to go out of doors ,  yet something leads me there .	0
but i know to be up late is to be up late .	0
our feast shall be very honored by your marriage.	0
please come in .	0
that i have labored with all my wits ,  my pains ,  and strong endeavors ,  to bring your most imperial majesties unto this bar and royal interview ,  your mightiness on both parts best can witness .	0
for the one ,  i have neither words nor measure; and for the other ,  i have no strength in measure ,  yet a reasonable measure in strength .	0
as a wandering lunatic ,  he can do whatever he wants .	0
marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!	0
no ,  my profound heart .	0
i have received letters that say the same .	0
and so far blameless proves my enterprise ,  that i have 'nointed an athenian's eyes; and so far am i glad it so did sort ,  as this their jangling i esteem a sport .	0
go put on thy defenses .	0
lurk ,  lurk .	0
no, madam; we have selected the necessary things that are useful for our event tomorrow.	0
i pray thee ,  stay with us ,  go not to wittenberg .	0
can you love the gentleman?	0
so pardon him ,  dear father ,  for my sake .	0
his fault concludes but what the law should end ,  the life of tybalt .	0
doing is activity ,  and he will still be doing .	0
what did you say?	0
pray ,  give me that; i'll carry it to the pile .	0
until then, god be with you!	0
good - night ,  lieutenant; i must get going to the guard .	0
where hast thou sent the king ?	0
arm you ,  i pray you ,  to this speedy voyage; for we will fetters put upon this fear ,  which now goes too free - footed .	0
drunk ?	0
o monstrous ,  monstrous !	0
this is his second fit like this .	0
the ides of march are come.	0
and why ,  my lady wisdom ?	0
will your highness please grace us with your royal company ?	0
it is much, that the moor should be more than reason: but if she be less than an honest woman, she is, indeed more than i took her for.	0
when prospero is destroyed .	0
aside.	0
if so ,  when it’s day ,  where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?	0
i’ll test it out .	0
for those that mingle reason with your passion must be content to think you old ,  and so— but she knows what she does .	0
i thought that all things had been savage here ,  and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment .	0
is't far you ride?	0
but soft!	0
such a one am i to fear, or none.	0
i was the other day talking on the sea - bank with certain venetians ,  and thither comes the bauble and ,  by this hand ,  she falls me thus about my neck— crying  “ o dear cassio !  ”  as it were .	0
please ,  don’t turn me around so much: my stomach is upset .	0
o ye immortal gods !	0
send for the man and ask him .	0
peaseblossom.	0
say it ,  othello .	0
the boy was the very staff of my age ,  my very prop .	0
had he not resembled my father as he slept ,  i had done't .	0
knock ,  knock ,  knock .	0
you feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .	0
antonio ,  as i heard in genoa , — what ,  what ,  what ?	0
talk you of killing ?	0
i’m not going to waste any more time with you .	0
hast thou found my daughter?	0
be comforted.	0
i’ll pretend to be the housewife for once .	0
your castle is surprised; your wife and babes savagely slaughter'd.	0
he, he, it is he.	0
come now ,  keep thine oath .	0
i am the youngest man by that name ,  because there is no one younger ,  or worse .	0
but i’ll catch thine eyes ,  though they had wings .	0
quick, quick!	0
do you hear ?	0
time and happiness can run through the roughest day .	0
o god, your only jig-maker!	0
though i am mad ,  i will not bite him .	0
may you choke on any other sentiments like that !	0
with a touch of green in it.	0
lead us away.	0
this fortification, gentlemen, shall we see it?	0
was it not yesterday we spoke together ?	0
she’s alive .	0
what night - rule now about this haunted grove ?	0
is it possible, my lord?	0
no sound, no word?	0
i do not like the office; but sith i am enter'd in this cause so far ,  prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love ,  i will go on .	0
that way ,  he’ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers ,  weakening his own capacities ,  while we ,  lying still ,  are rested ,  energetic ,  and nimble .	0
you nymphs ,  called water nymphs ,  of the winding brooks ,  with your oat - edged crowns and always harmless looks ,  leave your fresh waters ,  and answer your summons to this green land: juno commands you .	0
come ,  you spirits that tend on mortal thoughts ,  unsex me here and fill me ,  from the crown to the toe ,  top - full of direst cruelty !	0
i have drunk but one cup tonight ,  and that was craftily qualified too ,  and behold what innovation it makes here .	0
father ,  come; i'll take my leave of the jew in the twinkling of an eye .	0
i have forgotten your name ,  but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly .	0
i am not long ,  i guarantee ,  for this world .	0
if you be not mad ,  be gone .	0
ma'am ,  you wouldn’t treat me like this if i were your father’s dog .	0
i pardon that man .	0
nay ,  an thou'lt mouth ,  i'll rant as well as thou .	0
o treachery !	0
can’t you tell that ?	0
i prithee ,  do so .	0
more than prince of cats ,  i can tell you .	0
call her forth to me .	0
mad call i it; for, to define true madness, what is't but to be nothing else but mad?	0
forgotten you !	0
i have done the state some service ,  and they know it .	0
fare thee well .	0
where shall we go ?	0
yes ,  from the table of my memory i’ll wipe away all unimportant records ,  all kinds of books ,  all pictures ,  all pressures past ,  that my youth and observations wrote there ,  and your commandment all by itself shall live within the book and volume of my brain ,  unmixed with other low thoughts .	0
the moral of this story is that it’s not enough to speak; you have to speak grammatically .	0
let me talk to you about your situation .	0
so far he topp'd my thought that i ,  in forgery of shapes and tricks ,  come short of what he did .	0
o romeo, romeo!	0
othello ?	0
go, girl, seek these happy nights to give you happy days.	0
long live she so !	0
he.	0
but tell me why you proceeded not against these feats so crimeful and so capital in nature, as by your safety, wisdom, all things else, you mainly were stirr'd up.	0
we are resolved ,  my lord .	0
maybe ,  iago ,  i will never go home .	0
what's this to my lysander?	0
shall i abide in this dull world ,  which in thy absence is no better than a sty ?	0
as of a man faithful and honorable.	0
what profane wretch art thou?	0
i beseech you .	0
when was there ever an age ,  since the beginning of time ,  that didn’t feature more than one famous man ?	0
thinking ,  my lord ?	0
we have god and a good cause on our side .	0
if i were king ?	0
i will this night, in several hands, in at his windows throw, as if they came from several citizens, writings, all tending to the great opinion that rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.	0
one of these three contains her heavenly picture .	0
my powers are crescent ,  and my auguring hope says it will come to th’ full .	0
be not lost so poorly in your thoughts.	0
truly ,  a great arithmetician ,  one michael cassio ,  a florentine ,  a fellow almost damned in a having a beautiful wife; that has never led a squadron in the field ,  and doesn’t know the division of a battle any more than a spinster does ,  unless the theory books ,  in which the consuls wearing togas can propose a plan as masterly as he can .	0
farewell .	0
you are welcome, gentlemen!	0
my soul is full of discord and dismay .	0
don’t be disturbed by my weakness.	0
he was my friend ,  he was faithful and just to me .	0
a jealous woman’s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog .	0
how happy some o'er other some can be !	0
i embrace it freely ,  and will this brother's wager frankly play . — give us the foils .	0
i pray thee give it me.	0
leave wringing of your hands .	0
doesn’t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?	0
thou know’st ’tis common .	0
for ,  i am sure ,  you have your hands full all in this so sudden business .	0
this, casca; this, cinna, and this, metellus cimber.	0
i know my hour is come .	0
o dear account !	0
i see thee yet ,  in form as palpable as this which now i draw .	0
sweet mistress—i don’t know what other name to give you ,  or how you’ve figured out mine—you seem as	0
buzz ,  buzz .	0
my royal cousin ,  teach you our princess english ?	0
you heard her say herself, it was not i.	0
do you hear what i’m saying ,  iago ?	0
then i’ll know exactly what she is ,  just as i know what i am .	0
i'll “re” you, i'll “fa” you.	0
you are welcome, sir, to cyprus.	0
ay, madam.	0
if we’re  hello ,  monsieur le beau .	0
and after that ,  he came thus sad away ?	0
i say ,  amen .	0
don’t be afraid .	0
what is logical ,  then ,  my lord ?	0
when he wakes up !	0
so kind a father ! —be my horses ready ?	0
my bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .	0
o regan ,  she hath tied sharp - toothed unkindness ,  like a vulture ,  here .	0
wherefore?	0
i shall obey ,  my lord .	0
o day and night, but this is wondrous strange!	0
o ,  sweet my mother ,  don’t push me away !	0
i won’t have any of this .	0
i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge ,  insomuch i say i know you are .	0
cassio doesn’t know you .	0
i never saw the necklace ,  so help me heaven !	0
will you help ? —an ass - head ,  and a coxcomb ,  and a knave ,  a thin - faced knave ,  a gull !	0
o my ,  where are you ?	0
go home ,  you idle creatures ,  go home !	0
lord babyface over there will meet me in a duel ,  and good luck to him then .	0
the hour of death is approaching .	0
why ,  what’s a moveable ?	0
what’s here ?	0
you must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition .	0
being in the city was better for them in regards to their reputation and their profits.	0
i will say so.	0
blow ,  wind !	0
i could play ercles rarely ,  or a part to tear a cat in to make all split .	0
how silver - sweet sound lovers' tongues by night ,  like softest music to attending ears !	0
why, 'tis an office of discovery, love; and i should be obscur'd.	0
stay !	0
three months from twelve; then let me see the rate.	0
my lord ?	0
at this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .	0
learn to see better ,  lear ,  and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice .	0
captain fluellen .	0
crazy ”  i’m calling it ,  since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it’s craziness ?	0
what ,  are we having a feast ?	0
nine or ten times i had thought t' have yerked him here under the ribs .	0
take them in .	0
oh ,  these men ,  these men !	0
she speaks ,  but she says nothing .	0
why ,  he that cuts off twenty years of life cuts off so many years of fearing death .	0
i’m sweating and trembling with fear .	0
you know i say nothing to him; for he understands not me ,  nor i him: he hath neither latin ,  french ,  nor italian; and you will come into the court ,  and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english .	0
tis brief ,  my lord .	0
over hill ,  over dale ,  through bush ,  through brier ,  over park ,  over pale ,  through flood ,  through fire ,  i am going everywhere ,  quicker than the moon goes through the sky; and i serve the fairy queen ,  to put dewdrops into her eyes upon the green .	0
adieu!—tears exhibit my tongue.	0
what ,  gone ?	0
farewell .	0
i’ll do that .	0
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.	0
i saw him not .	0
well ,  the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer .	0
where is my lovely bride ?	0
i’ve sent twenty people to look for you .	0
when being not at your lodging to be found the senate hath sent about three several guests to search you out .	0
o heavy day!	0
you were best to tell antonio what you hear; yet do not suddenly ,  for it may grieve him .	0
god’s wounds, show me what you'll do.	0
it will not be seen in him there .	0
may not one speak?	0
the plainsong ”  is most just ,  for humors do abound .	0
you have slept well; awake!	0
ok, so that’s the way the game goes.	0
i beg you ,  come in .	0
the story is extant ,  and writ in choice italian .	0
hear me, for i will speak.	0
you’ll have to leave tonight .	0
stay away for now ,  and good night ,  my sweet friend .	0
patience awhile ,  good cassio .	0
the english are embattled ,  you french peers .	0
and when she put it on ,  she made me vow that i should neither sell nor give nor lose it .	0
here comes the furious tybalt back again .	0
he has ,  and many more just like him that i know the worthless age dotes on ,  are only part of a craze and have the outward appearance of style ,  a kind of swollen collection ,  which carries them through and through the most airless opinions and only blows them to their real experience when the bubbles are burst .	0
sits . —i did never think that lady would have loved any man .	0
then there were two cousins laid up ,  when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .	0
a seventh !	0
what’s the matter ,  dear ?	0
that you’ve wronged me shows in this action: you’ve condemned and punished lucius pella for taking bribes from the sardians here ,  and my letters ,  taking his side because i knew the man ,  were blown off .	0
why, get you gone!	0
i’m done, my lord.	0
oh ,  i am undone ,  i am undone !	0
what is his name ?	0
why doth the jew pause?	0
lead away .	0
but aren’t some well that we must make sick ?	0
why, how can you, hamlet!	0
pray you ,  no more of this .	0
the king is not responsible for it .	0
i saw the handkerchief .	0
he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!	0
no ,  i’ll go find some ditch to die in .	0
although you bring me joy ,  i can’t take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .	0
yes ,  madam ,  that’s the one .	0
what visions have i seen !	0
what didn’t you like ?	0
pronounce that sentence then on me ,  my liege .	0
good evening, casca.	0
nay ,  but beatrice— sweet hero ,  she is wronged ,  she is slandered ,  she is undone .	0
why ,  how now ,  cousin !	0
spoke like an officer !	0
and yesterday ,  the night bird sat in the marketplace ,  in the middle of the day ,  howling and shrieking .	0
you don’t know a thing !	0
thou most lying slave, whom stripes may move, not kindness!	0
but beshrew my jealousy !	0
what's your grace's will?	0
no, in all confidence, the turks are not going to rhodes.	0
why are you telling me about robbing ?	0
oh ,  and monsieur ,  be careful not to break the honey - sac .	0
but indeed ,  sir ,  we make holiday ,  to see caesar and to rejoice in his triumph .	0
i’ll attend her here and woo her with some spirit when she comes .	0
oh ,  give us leave ,  great king ,  to view the field in safety and dispose of their dead bodies .	0
except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title—in french ,   and even this i’m willing to grant if you request it .	0
excellent wretch !	0
for shame, for shame!	0
knock knock knock ,  knock !	0
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; speak but one rhyme ,  and i am satisfied !	0
it well appears .	0
i am required by oath to observe three things: first ,  never to tell anyone which chest i chose; next ,  if i fail to choose the right chest ,  i will never court a maid to marry for my whole life; lastly ,  if i do fail in choosing the right chest ,  i will leave you immediately and be gone .	0
the will of man is by his reason sway'd, and reason says you are the worthier maid.	0
go immediately ,  and do exactly as i wrote down .	0
an if you leave me so, you do me wrong.	0
they’re the rebels.—o conspiracy, shame on you for showing your dangerous eyes by night when evils are most free?	0
o murderous slave !	0
no ,  after you .	0
if this deed were done when it is done, then it would be better if it were done quickly.	0
who wants to speak with me ?	0
if you choose that wherein i am contained ,  straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized .	0
give me my sword .	0
let the earth hide thee !	0
meseemeth good that with some little train forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet hither to london ,  to be crowned our king .	0
bring that swinger orlando here .	0
i am sorry thou wilt leave my father so .	0
where is my lady?	0
when they next wake ,  all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision; and back to athens shall the lovers wend ,  with league whose date till death shall never end .	0
and this .	0
come with a thought .	0
heaven make thee free of it!	0
foolish wench ,  to th' most of men this is a caliban and they to him are angels .	0
i swear i will ,  and if i ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .	0
i’ll torture him .	0
who comes with her ?	0
now you sound like a man .	0
why are you curious ,  iago ?	0
face not me .	0
to the first and the last ,  a hearty welcome .	0
but ships are but boards ,  sailors but men: there be land - rats and water - rats ,  land - thieves and water - thieves; i mean ,  pirates; and then ,  there is the peril of waters ,  winds ,  and rocks .	0
would it not make one weep ?	0
a very nasty meaning .	0
what do you think?	0
brave titinius !	0
let specialties be therefore drawn between us ,  that covenants may be kept on either hand .	0
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.	0
and lovers' absent hours ,  more tedious than the dial eight score times ?	0
love cools off ,  friendships break up ,  and brothers become enemies .	0
how have you slept ,  my lord ?	0
how now ?	0
weren’t you sent for ?	0
were these things we’re talking about really here ?	0
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?	0
please, listen to me.	0
we’ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !	0
he has refused it in the open court; he shall merely have justice, and his promise to pay.	0
i won’t bother with it .	0
what is't you do ?	0
instead ,  she puts flowers in the boy’s hair and makes a fuss over him .	0
why ,  so i do .	0
were you born here in the forest ?	0
besides—i ha' not since put up my sword— against the capitol i met a lion, who glazed upon me and went surly by without annoying me: and there were drawn upon a heap a hundred ghastly women transformed with their fear, who swore they saw men all in fire walk up and down the streets.	0
romeo, away, be gone!	0
i’ll put up my shield and battle you .	0
and i’m going to sleep .	0
there is a lord will hear you play tonight; but i am doubtful of your modesties ,  lest over - eyeing of his odd behavior— for yet his honor never heard a play— you break into some merry passion and so offend him .	0
what!	0
safe, antony, brutus is safe enough.	0
hear me yet, good shylock.	0
will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?	0
go as fast as you can .	0
peace !	0
your guardian angel is noble ,  courageous ,  significant ,  and unmatched when caesar’s not around .	0
i have done no harm .	0
our duties ,  and the pledge .	0
they shouted thrice .	0
here comes lorenzo .	0
i marry her !	0
i never may believe these antique fables ,  or these fairy toys .	0
no noise ,  and enter .	0
good to see you, iago.	0
well ,  that’s really my job .	0
and neither will i until i see mine again .	0
and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter .	0
if i have punished you too harshly ,  your payment makes up for it ,  because i have given you here a third of my own life ,  or the part for which i live ,  who ,  once again ,  i give to you .	0
i do assure thee ,  father ,  so it is .	0
did you call for me ,  your worship ?	0
and for my name of george begins with  it follows in his thought that i am he .	0
he kills her in her own humor .	0
what false impression did i give you ?	0
come ,  we’ll have him in a dark room and bound .	0
it would have much amazed you.	0
i cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.	0
i’ll follow it .	0
if, rather than to marry count paris you have the strength of will to kill yourself, then is it likely you will try something like death to chase this shame away, something that will cover you with death himself, to escape from it?	0
how like a fawning publican he looks !	0
you lie .	0
as wicked as i am ,  they were slaughtered because of me ,  not because of anything they did .	0
o heavy lightness !	0
what’s going on ?	0
hence ,  lest that th' infection of his fortune take like hold on thee .	0
god be with you .	0
madam ,  count orsino’s young messenger has returned .	0
believe me ,  sir ,  had i such venture forth ,  the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad .	0
i charge you ,  as you hope to have redemption ,  by christ’s dear blood shed for our grievous sins ,  that you depart ,  and lay no hands on me .	0
i think you do; and, because i know you are full of love and honesty and weigh your words carefully before saying them, these stops of yours frighten me even more, because such things in a false, disloyal rogue are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just they're hidden delays, working from the heart, that passion cannot control.	0
let me gather my wits and get serious here .	0
bring him ,  dead or living ,  within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory .	0
i kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.	0
let him approach .	0
once more ,  leave ,  good friends .	0
thank you .	0
as love is ,  my lord ,  before it loves .	0
nothing certainer .	0
we must not .	0
herein i teach you how you shall bid god ’ild us for your pains ,  and thank us for your trouble .	0
of course i will .	0
you’ve described a hot friend cooling off .	0
goodness ,  it’s daylight .	0
i’ve always been straightforward with you ,  so now i’m telling you what i think .	0
feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!	0
i’ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven ,  praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year .	0
the hearts of old gave hands, but our new code of behavior is hands, not hearts.	0
most noble brother ,  you have done me wrong .	0
leave you!	0
i just speak directly .	0
that these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .	0
if the earth could be flooded with woman's tears, each drop she lets fall would prove to be a crocodile.	0
therefore you must needs play pyramus .	0
amen, with all my heart!	0
and what to ?	0
the ears are senseless that should give us hearing ,  to tell him his commandment is fulfilled ,  that rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead .	0
that don john had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the lady hero .	0
a happiness that often madness hits on ,  which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of .	0
dearest ,  kindest ,  most honorable sir ,  may i say ,  with your esteemed approval ,  which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun - god phoebus ,  that— what do you mean by that ?	0
back ,  foolish tears ,  back to your native spring !	0
come ,  in what key shall a man take you to go in the song ?	0
boy ,  run to the senate - house; don’t wait to answer me ,  but get going .	0
and you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn’t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me .  ”  oh ,  how monstrously evil !	0
my poverty but not my will consents.	0
did you know him?	0
why ,  the one i just told you about .	0
i this infer: that many things ,  having full reference to one consent ,  may work contrariously ,  as many arrows loosèd several ways come to one mark ,  as many ways meet in one town ,  as many fresh streams meet in one salt sea ,  as many lines close in the dial’s center ,  so may a thousand actions ,  once afoot ,  end in one purpose ,  and be all well borne without defeat .	0
marry ,  they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old .	0
the very place puts toys of desperation, without more motive, into every brain that looks so many fathoms to the sea and hears it roar beneath.	0
but the man who carried my letter, friar john, was delayed by accident, and last night returned my letter to me.	0
i will leave him .	0
catesby .	0
let me live here forever .	0
how now ,  you dog ?	0
because i didn’t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails ,  or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh .	0
i know i’m not fooling myself ,  or letting myself get carried away by my imagination ,  because every clue points to the fact that lady olivia loves me .	0
hast thou not a word of joy ?	0
committed!	0
we come to hate that which controls us .	0
why dost thou lead these men about the streets ?	0
and look where publius is come to fetch me .	0
then does he say he lent me some shipping ,  unrestored .	0
i do not like the tower ,  of any place . — did julius caesar build that place ,  my lord ?	0
my cause is fixed in my heart; yours has no less reason .	0
you perhaps may think ,  because she is something lower than myself ,  that i can match her .	0
but that i love thee best, o most best, believe it.	0
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke; it weeps ,  it bleeds ,  and each new day a gash is added to her wounds .	0
welcome ,  wanderer .	0
it is offended.	0
you don’t look well ,  antonio .	0
post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.	0
o misery!	0
is this the prince ?	0
most horrible !	0
it’s—but he’s drowned ,  and these guys are devils .	0
it’s torture, and not mercy.	0
to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughtered him !	0
what ,  are you dead ,  my dove ?	0
they	0
this sounds as if i am praising of myself; so ,  no more about it; listen to other things .	0
do you think it is easier to play me than a pipe?	0
by mary, well said, very well said.	0
what ,  good lord ,  boy !	0
next month with us .	0
come ,  firebrands ,  over here !	0
you shall see many a duteous and knee-bending rogue that, doting on his own obedient slavery, wears himself out, much like his master's ass, for nothing but dry oats; and when he's old, dismissed from the service.	0
my lord ,  good morrow .	0
how say you ?	0
that’s what she was expecting ,  and you let her down .	0
believe me based on my honor, and have respect for my honor, so you can believe.	0
so when should he come ?	0
doesn’t it go well?	0
enough .	0
i shall not dine at home; i meet the captains at the citadel .	0
my dear?	0
pretty soul!	0
and isn’t it to be damned to let this canker of our nature do further evil ?	0
alright ,  here’s the vial .	0
my lady !	0
what harmony is this ?	0
o, forgive me, you bleeding piece of earth, that i’m meek and gentle with these butchers!	0
there could i have him now—and there—and there again—and there .	0
we’ll write it in alternating eight -  and six - syllable lines ,  just like in a ballad .	0
that would hang us, every mother's son.	0
may your love never change until your sweet life ends !	0
i had else been perfect ,  whole as the marble ,  founded as the rock ,  as broad and general as the casing air .	0
with his own bolt;     the strong - based promontory have i made shake ,  and by the spurs plucked up the pine and cedar; graves at my command have waked their sleepers ,  oped ,  and let 'em forth by my so potent art .	0
of all the strange things i’ve ever heard ,  it seems most strange to me that men fear death ,  given that death ,  which can’t be avoided ,  will come whenever it wants .	0
i’d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .	0
it’s me ,  my lord ,  and your poor servant forever .	0
the crow sings as sweetly as the lark when either is waited on, and i think the nightingale, if she sang by day, when every goose is cackling, would be considered no better a musician than the wren.	0
i swear to you— you have a good heart ,  and believe me ,  i’ll tell her that .	0
why dost thou ask ?	0
good old lord gonzalo ,  ”  as you call him ,  is saddest of all ,  with tears running down his beard .	0
that is done too ,  sir ,  only 'cover' is the word .	0
let’s briefly put on manly readiness ,  and meet i' th' hall together .	0
we have none such ,  sir .	0
my mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush .	0
where is the count’s page who called the guards?	0
be assured we go to use our hands and not our tongues .	0
how now, horatio?	0
and i, of ladies most deject and wretched, that suck'd the honey of his music vows, now see that noble and most sovereign reason, like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; that unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth blasted with ecstasy.	0
through the house give glimmering light ,  by the dead and drowsy fire; every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier; and this ditty ,  after me ,  sing and dance it trippingly .	0
father ,  go ahead .	0
i have made bold, iago, to send for your wife.	0
now will i question cassio of bianca ,  a housewife that by selling her desires buys herself bread and clothes .	0
revenges burn in them, for their dear causes would to the bleeding and the grim alarm excite the mortified man.	0
god bless you !	0
they in themselves ,  to tell the truth ,  are as light as a flute .	0
what's the newest grief?	0
i will have none on ’t .	0
i do believe it was he .	0
we’ll answer .	0
you always know he’s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto .	0
room for antony ,  most noble antony !	0
bring me to octavius .	0
tis given out that, sleeping in mine orchard, a serpent stung me.	0
that’s him .	0
alas, what does this gentleman conceive?	0
never apologize—when the actors are all dead ,  no one can be blamed .	0
to fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?	0
are you at leisure ,  holy father ,  now ,  or shall i come to you at evening mass ?	0
a friendly eye could never see such faults.	0
will you help me ?	0
how ?	0
to suckle fools and chronicle small beer .	0
why then ,  lead on .	0
piece of cheese will get him . —i challenge you to a match .	0
good friends ,  go in ,  and taste some wine with me; and we ,  like friends ,  will go ahead together straightaway .	0
i'm out of patience .	0
tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word macduff is fled to england.	0
what would you have ?	0
o woe!	0
good fool ,  good jester ,  i’ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle ,  and a pen ,  ink and paper .	0
to adrian] how lush and lusty the grass looks!	0
upon the heath.	0
although i can’t make his ship disappear ,  i can still make his journey miserable .	0
that hath made him mad.	0
what’s the matter ,  lieutenant ?	0
not a chance !	0
hum ,  i have heard that guilty creatures ,  sitting at a play ,  have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim'd their malefactions; for murder ,  though it have no tongue ,  will speak with most miraculous organ ,  i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle .	0
and be not jealous on me ,  gentle brutus .	0
your worship in that sense may call him man.	0
do it quickly .	0
if i do die before thee ,  prithee shroud me in one of those same sheets .	0
to antonio] no marrying ’mong his subjects?	0
so ho !	0
note this before my notes: there’s not a note of mine that’s worth the noting .	0
not for thy fairy kingdom . —fairies ,  away !	0
fine ,  i' faith !	0
oh that my prayers could be answered with such affection!	0
sometimes ,  imitate lysander’s voice ,  to stir up demetrius’ anger; and sometimes ,  sound like demetrius; and that way you can lead them from each other ,  until sleep imitating death creeps over their eyebrows with leaden legs and batty wings .	0
this was his basket .	0
our time does call upon ’s .	0
well praised!	0
upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit ,  for ’tis a throne where honor may be crowned .	0
there is a brief list of how many events there are; make choice of which your highness will see first.	0
when last i was at exeter ,  the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle and called it rougemont ,  at which name i started ,  because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond .	0
what woven country - folk do we have swaggering here ,  so near the cradle of the fairy queen ?	0
you ,  mistress ,  all this coil is long of you .	0
there’s nothing wrong with that, but still be patient in all.	0
faith ,  i intend so .	0
to my sick soul ,  such as sin's true nature is ,  each new thing seems to be the prelude to some great harm .	0
then ,  brutus ,  i have much mistook your passion ,  by means whereof this breast of mine hath buried thoughts of great value ,  worthy cogitations .	0
this is the fairy land .	0
oh ,  pomfret ,  pomfret !	0
the will !	0
nor i; my spirits are nimble .	0
i’ll open my arms wide like this to his good friends, and, like the pelican of the old fables, feed them with my own blood.	0
i should have been more strange ,  i must confess ,  but that thou overheard'st ,  ere i was ware ,  my true love's passion .	0
i hope ,  in no place so unsanctified or shamed as where such as you may find him .	0
though it be honest ,  it is never good to bring bad news .	0
in wisdom i should ask thy name .	0
welcome from mantua .	0
your servant shall do so .	0
how is it, my soul?	0
is there division ’twixt my lord and cassio ?	0
let them be hunted soundly.	0
did you by indirect and forced courses subdue and poison this young maid's affections ?	0
nay, good lieutenant; i pray you, sir, hold your hand.	0
come for the third ,  laertes !	0
o, he's the courageous captain of compliments.	0
if i had as many eyes as you’ve got wounds, weeping as fast as they let your blood out, it would suit me better than to close in terms of friendship with your enemies.	0
my name is roderigo.	0
fair princess ,  you have lost much good sport .	0
make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.	0
this was well done, my bird.	0
i see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before.	0
but ,  good laertes ,  will you do this ,  keep close within your chamber .	0
but if you do fight, sir, then i will fight you.	0
yes ,  that’s the idea .	0
but leave it all to god .	0
murder most foul ,  as in the best it is .	0
go to; well said, well said.	0
here, my lord.	0
then i guess beggars are the ones with bodies ,  while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars .	0
about a hoop of gold ,  a paltry ring that she did give me ,  whose posy was for all the world like cutler’s poetry upon a knife ,   “ love me and leave me not .  ”  what talk you of the posy or the value ?	0
oh ,  cassius ,  i’ll run far from this country to where no romans can find me .	0
my lord, you once did love me.	0
offspring of a witch ,  come here !	0
the grief that does not speak whispers the o'er fraught heart, and bids it break.	0
o peer !	0
we should have met you by sea and land ,  supplying every stage with an augmented greeting .	0
let me work on him .	0
i wish your loyalty were as foolish .	0
i know he will be happy at our success: we are the jasons ,  we have won the fleece .	0
hamlet in madness hath polonius slain ,  and from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him .	0
then go quickly to friar lawrence' cell; a husband waits there to make you a wife .	0
a rogue teaching me my duty!	0
yes ,  here i tender it for him in the court; yea ,  twice the sum: if that will not suffice ,  i will be bound to pay it ten times o'er ,  on forfeit of my hands ,  my head ,  my heart: if this will not suffice ,  it must appear that malice bears down truth .	0
tonight we host a solemn supper, sir, and i'll request your presence.	0
with courtesy and with respect enough ,  but not with such familiar instances ,  nor with such free and friendly conference ,  as he hath used of old .	0
i’ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .	0
no more of that .	0
and yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .	0
this one ?	0
help ,  help ,  ho !	0
no ,  please ,  i beg your majesty .	0
oh well done !	0
i’ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen ,  once again .	0
for pity’s sake ,  for pity’s sake !	0
why, what you will.	0
ah ,  poor my lord ,  what tongue shall smooth thy name when i ,  thy three - hours’ wife ,  have mangled it ?	0
it’s stopped now—it must be played for some local god of the island .	0
yet i should kill thee with much cherishing.	0
o god!	0
i have been your tenant and your father’s tenant these fourscore years .	0
have you not set lysander, as in scorn, to follow me and praise my eyes and face?	0
i could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .	0
what private griefs they have ,  alas ,  i know not ,  that made them do it .	0
if things are the way people tell me they are—and they’re only telling me this to warn me—then i have to say ,  you’re not conducting yourself with the self - restraint a daughter of mine should show .	0
don’t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword .	0
is it answered ?	0
go with me ,  silvius .	0
have patience and endure .	0
bring in my lord.	0
the accessory of a welcome is fashion and ceremony .	0
i know him well.	0
then must the jew be merciful .	0
and, gentle puck, take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain, that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair, and think no more of this night's accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream.	0
i am not guilty of killing lysander; and he isn’t dead, as far as i can tell.	0
well ,  go along now .	0
i’m glad to see you in such a merry mood .	0
where should i fly ?	0
things growing are not ripe until their season .	0
god bless you for doing this .	0
he’s dead and rotting in the dirt now .	0
wilt thou go with me?	0
indeed ?	0
the moor!	0
here ,  sir ,  this is a ring she asked me to give you .	0
oh ,  you’re a naughty one ,  encouraging double - dealing .	0
good heavens !	0
he answered ,   “ you penniless bastard !	0
lady ,  shall i lie in your lap ?	0
a messenger from caesar .	0
so should he look that seems to speak things strange .	0
well then ,  go you into hell ?	0
go with me to bless this twain ,  that they may prospus be and honoured in their issue .	0
stand to ’t .	0
prithee ,  my king ,  be quiet .	0
who comes with her ?	0
the testament!	0
portia is dead .	0
some two months away, up higher toward the north, he first shines, and the high east stands, just as the capitol, directly here.	0
o, there be players that i have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of christians, nor the gait of christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that i have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.	0
good my lord ,  will you see the players well bestow'd ?	0
in thunder ,  lightning ,  or in rain ?	0
the queen ,  your mother ,  in most great affliction of spirit ,  has sent me to you .	0
i am content ,  if that’s the way you want it .	0
not because we love words better, as you do.	0
i’m a nobleman ,  and i know what i’m doing in assigning this job to you .	0
let’s go, because it is after midnight, and, before day, we’ll wake him up, and be sure that he’s with us.	0
and don’t be angry with me, gentle brutus; i wish i were a common comedian, or used to urinating on my friendship with ordinary oaths to every new opponent; if you know that i show false friendship to some men, and hug them hard and after that, tell lies about them, or if you know that i profess myself at feasts to be friends with the entire place, then think about me dangerous.	0
o ,  pardon ,  sir ,  it does ,  and the gray lines over there that adorn the clouds are the messengers of dawn .	0
i swear ,  my honored lord ,  it is true ,  and we thought it was our duty to let you know about it .	0
you have of late stood out against your brother ,  and he hath ta'en you newly into his grace ,  where it is impossible you should take true root but by the fair weather that you make yourself .	0
besides, it seems that, even if he had the money right now to pay the jew, he wouldn’t take it.	0
fathers who wear rags make their children neglect them .	0
knock knock hark!	0
he waits very nearby, to know your answer, whether you'll admit him.	0
under love's heavy burden ,  i would sink .	0
damn them then, if ever mortal eyes do see them bolster more than their own!	0
don’t be crass . —you all look confused .	0
most humbly do i take my leave, my lord.	0
he ,  he ,  ’tis he .	0
twill out ,  'twill .	0
let’s do it.	0
we are glad the dauphin is so pleasant with us .	0
a crutch, a crutch!	0
oh ,  then belike she was old and gentle ,  and you rode ,  like a kern of ireland ,  your french hose off and in your straight strossers .	0
why ,  sir ,  i trust i may have leave to speak ,  and speak i will .	0
in faith ,  he's very sorry; and yet his crime ,  in our common reason ,  except that ,  they say ,  the wars must make examples out of their best ,  is not almost a fault to incur a private punishment .	0
i won’t argue with her ,  so her beautiful body won’t disarm me . —tonight ,  iago .	0
i’m sorry i hit you .	0
when the talk was about the poisoning ?	0
my naked weapon is out .	0
that really would be kind .	0
aren’t you listening to me speak ?	0
here we’ll shake hands good - bye .	0
my lord, i do not know that i did cry.	0
they are about the court ,  and ,  as i think ,  they have already order this night to play before him .	0
but i will tarry .	0
poor ropes, you are beguil'd, both you and i, for romeo is exil'd.	0
i’ll do my best to obey you, madam.	0
come, high or low; yourself and duties skillfully show!	0
but i’ll go in .	0
strange things i have in head that will to hand ,  which must be acted ere they may be scann'd .	0
leave them alone until he sets off home ,  and then follow him .	0
peace ,  ho !	0
must i give way and room to your rash choler?	0
o heavens!	0
a light ,  a light !	0
and so have i a noble father lost; a sister driven into desperate terms ,  whose worth ,  if praises may go back again ,  stood challenger on mount of all the age for her perfections .	0
i beg you ,  youth ,  don’t put another sin on my head by urging me to fight .	0
heaven and earth !	0
that villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.	0
thomas ,  the earl of surrey ,  and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers .	0
if good, why do i yield to that suggestion whose horrid image doth unfix my hair and make my seated heart knock at my ribs, against the use of nature?	0
i will follow you .	0
because who is this man they follow ?	0
how ?	0
that is the sum of all ,  leonato . —signior claudio and signior benedick ,  my dear friend leonato hath invited you all .	0
i wish your undertaking today may thrive .	0
o villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!	0
what ,  you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil i’m warning you about ?	0
i will be brief ,  for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale .	0
farewell .	0
no ,  my dear'st love ,  i would not for the world .	0
do not weep ,  do not weep .	0
o most wicked ,  evil woman !	0
age hasn’t dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much ,  and luck hasn’t robbed me of so much of my fortune ,  and my bad ways haven’t deprived me of so many friends ,  that they won’t find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally ,  with money and friends at my disposal .	0
answer me in a word .	0
come ,  i’ll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .	0
i won’t consider it .	0
what ,  dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel ,  and soothe the devil that i warn thee from ?	0
a common slave—you know him well by sight— held up his left hand, which did flame and burn like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand, not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.	0
o earth ,  which this blood drink’st revenge his death !	0
who’s there ?	0
i hate a drunken rogue .	0
you are welcome, sir, to cyprus.	0
tis dangerous when the baser nature comes between the pass and fell incensed points of mighty opposites.	0
that’s him ,  madam .	0
the time and my intents are savage and wild ,  so much ore fierce and more determined than hungry tigers or the roaring sea .	0
tis bargained ’twixt us twain ,  being alone ,  that she shall still be curst in company .	0
what means your grace ?	0
everything would be produced without labor ,  and would be shared by all .	0
finally ,  after shaking my arm a little ,  and jerking his head up and down three times ,  he sighed like it was his last breath .	0
hark ye ,  your romeo will be here at night .	0
i'll run from you ,  and hide in the bushes ,  and leave you to the mercy of wild beasts .	0
you sound like a cattle dealer: that’s the way they sell bulls .	0
an if i could ,  what should i get therefore ?	0
oh ,  farewell !	0
i’ll know thy thoughts .	0
no ,  pompey ,  i haven’t had anything to drink .	0
this blows my heart .	0
but i spoke with someone who saw cawdor die ,  and he said that cawdor openly confessed his treasons ,  begged your highness’s forgiveness ,  and repented deeply .	0
to find out you .	0
i’m sick ,  charmian .	0
my best endeavours shall be done herein .	0
wait ,  and listen to me ,  countrymen .	0
where is she now ? —what ,  will my hands never be clean ? —no more of that ,  my lord ,  no more of that .	0
you lie out of it ,  sir ,  and therefore it’s not yours .	0
ay ,  to the proof ,  as mountains are for winds ,  that shakes not ,  though they blow perpetually .	0
for heaven's sake ,  help me !	0
i’ll make myself invisible ,  and i eavesdrop on their conversation .	0
or did i dream it so ?	0
sweet saint ,  for charity ,  be not so curst .	0
because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians ,  you’ll have your daughter covered with a barbary horse .	0
when the sea is .	0
does it not ,  think thee ,  stand me now upon— he that hath kill'd my king ,  and whored my mother; popp'd in between the election and my hopes; thrown out his angle for my proper life ,  and with such cozenage—is't not perfect conscience to quit him with this arm ?	0
has it come to this ?	0
let me see your eyes; look into my face .	0
she were an excellent wife for benedict .	0
unhappy fortune!	0
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt .	0
he’s killed his wife !	0
now we speak upon our cue ,  and our voice is imperial .	0
that’s as much as to say ,  the sweet youth’s in love .	0
ha !	0
how will you live?	0
no?	0
over hill ,  over dale ,   thorough bush ,  thorough brier ,   over park ,  over pale ,   thorough flood ,  thorough fire .	0
i will forestall their repair hither and say you are not fit .	0
there ,  where the torch is burning .	0
hello and god bless you ,  sir .	0
will you hear the letter ?	0
silence !	0
have you delivered to her our decree ?	0
do you agree that we shall tell him, because we love him and it is our duty?	0
clarence still breathes; edward still lives and reigns .	0
tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropped .	0
find out this villain ,  edmund .	0
it would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like macbeth .	0
go ahead ,  use your authority .	0
marry ,  heaven forbid !	0
let the bitter hussy kick, our saddles don’t pinch.	0
cure her of that .	0
no ,  my good knight .	0
i did nothing .	0
but if you know not this my manners tell me we have your wrong rebuke .	0
macduff ,  this noble passion ,  child of integrity ,  has wiped the black scruples from my soul ,  and reconciled my thoughts to your good truth and honor .	0
i look down towards his feet ,  but that’s a fable .	0
the king ,  sir ,  hath wagered with him six barbary horses ,  against the which he has impawned ,  as i take it ,  six french rapiers and poniards with their assigns—as girdle ,  hangers ,  and so .	0
nay ,  then you lie .	0
alack ,  for mercy !	0
if you be he ,  sir ,  i desire some confidence with you .	0
or that i had any friend would be a man for my sake !	0
that gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds, which too untimely here did scorn the earth.	0
come, desdemona, once more well met at cyprus.	0
for fear of that i still will stay with thee and never from this palace of dim night depart again.	0
and all my children?	0
had we fought ,  i doubt we should have been too young for them .	0
but i see you’re troubled .	0
my lord ,  i will use them according to their desert .	0
give him this deed ,  and let him sign it .	0
you’ll beat me ?	0
away ,  go away !	0
he shall not live; look ,  i condemn him with a check .	0
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance .	0
go carry them ,  and smear the sleepy grooms with blood .	0
adieu ,  good monsieur melancholy .	0
hold the friar too .	0
we see yonder the beginning of the day ,  but i think we shall never see the end of it . —who goes there ?	0
he hasn’t told this to the king ,  has he ?	0
where’s that dog ?	0
before my god, i might not believe this thing without the seeing and true testimony of my own eyes.	0
is't lost?	0
that's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly that they may seem the taints of liberty, the flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, a savageness in unreclaimed blood, of general assault.	0
you know where i live.	0
alas the day !	0
then shall i bleed to death .	0
when it’s all over ,  you only look at an empty stool .	0
should i go to church ,  and see the holy edifice of stone ,  and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks ,  which ,  touching but my gentle vessel's side ,  would scatter all her spices on the stream ,  enrobe the roaring waters with my silks ,  and ,  in a word ,  but even now worth this ,  and now worth nothing ?	0
i want my bond .	0
i’ll be good ,  sir .	0
what trade, thou knave?	0
it won’t make me jealous ,  to say my wife is beautiful ,  cooks well ,  loves company ,  is free of speech ,  sings ,  plays ,  and dances well; where virtue is ,  these are more virtuous .	0
i thought i was, and i thought i had,—but a man is only a mended fool, if he will offer to say what i thought i had.	0
twice then the trumpets sounded ,  and there i left him tranced .	0
where?	0
make peace with god ,  for you must die ,  my lord .	0
i will ,  my lord .	0
be near at hand; i mess it up.	0
to what, my love, shall i compare thine eyne?	0
and then ,  of so gentle a condition !	0
tell me ,  is your tardy master close at hand ?	0
so you’re admitting clarence ,  my father ,  is dead .	0
these are unnatural events .	0
fill, lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup; i cannot drink too much of brutus' love.	0
and i followed him because i loved him .	0
it is the lark that sings so out of tune ,  straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .	0
i thank you .	0
now i will question cassio about bianca ,  a housewife that ,  by selling her desires ,  buys herself bread and clothes .	0
how say you by this change?	0
the games are done and caesar is returning .	0
i'll warrant him for drowning ,  though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .	0
you are like one of these fellows that, when he enters the bar, throws his sword upon the table, and says ”god, i don’t want to use you!” and by the time he’s drunk the second cup draws the sword on the table, when, indeed, there is no need.	0
did he stare at you ?	0
oh ,  my son ,  what issue is that ?	0
am i your bird ?	0
his soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .	0
please ,  keep it to yourself .	0
nothing is good ,  i see ,  without respect: i think it sounds much sweeter at night than by day .	0
arise ,  fair sun ,  and kill the envious moon ,  who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she .	0
damn !	0
but on !	0
let her come in .	0
switch and spurs ,  switch and spurs ,  or i’ll cry a match .	0
pardon ,  my lord .	0
what part of her body is ireland ?	0
enough with the bad faces ,  and begin .	0
i drink to you .	0
sblood ,  there is something in this more than natural ,  if philosophy could find it out .	0
whatever happens to me ,  this is a soldier’s kiss .	0
then there is the count palatine .	0
they’re just fine ,  my dear madam .	0
i prithee let me hear it .	0
therefore beware my censure ,  and keep your promise .	0
a most high miracle.	0
the very best at a beast ,  my lord ,  that ever i saw .	0
don’t .	0
i’m sure i’ll feel guilty if i run away from this jew ,  my master .	0
so shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means i shall then have to prefer them, and the impediment most profitably removed, with- out the which there were no expectation of our prosperity.	0
thou hast slept well; awake .	0
he’s dead .	0
how now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!	0
and then for her to win the moor, were't to renounce his baptism, all seals and symbols of redeemed sin, his soul is so enfetter'd to her love, that she may make, unmake, do what she list, even as her appetite shall play the god with his weak function.	0
what's to do?	0
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.	0
have you no modesty ,  no maiden shame ,  no touch of bashfulness ?	0
four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster !	0
reproach and everlasting shame sits mocking in our plumes .	0
i'll find out your man ,  and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here .	0
she dies for ’t . —eros ,  ho !	0
you are so far ahead that swiftest way of repaying is slow to overtake you.	0
i say to you this house is dark .	0
what do you call the play ?	0
my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that begged it and indeed deserved it too .	0
this night i hold an old accustom'd feast ,  whereto i have invited many a guest ,  such as i love; and you among the store ,  one more ,  most welcome ,  makes my number more .	0
she hangs around me all the time .	0
thanks ,  rosencrantz and gentle guildenstern .	0
did you converse ,  sir ,  with this gentlewoman ?	0
i'll keep my oath ,  patiently to deal with my anger .	0
but hollow men ,  like horses hot at hand ,  make gallant show and promise of their mettle .	0
or like a whale.	0
you wronged yourself to write me letters in such a case.	0
but yet ,  madam— i don’t like the sound of  “ but yet .  ”  it reverses all the good that came before it .	0
a damnèd death !	0
dear duff ,  i prithee ,  contradict thyself ,  and say it is not so .	0
i’ll be waiting, a thousand times good night!	0
no ,  their work keeps them at their usual pace ,  but there is ,  sir ,  a brood of children ,  untrained ,  that complicate their situation ,  and are most tyrannically beaten for it .	0
ho ,  open the door .	0
o ,  he is crazy ,  laertes .	0
at different times)] listen ,  listen !	0
o woe !	0
i am glad he’s coming ,  however he’s dressed .	0
in return ,  i must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to rome .	0
you have loved him well .	0
thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report .	0
forbear to sleep the nights ,  and fast the days; compare dead happiness with living woe; think that thy babes were sweeter than they were ,  and he that slew them fouler than he is .	0
it was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .	0
all my pretty little children ?	0
they will tell me more ,  because i’m determined to know the worst about what’s going to happen .	0
welcome ,  dear rosencrantz and guildenstern !	0
if thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.	0
no ,  my heart is turned to stone; i strike it ,  and it hurts my hand .	0
tell me, daughter juliet, how stands your disposition to be married?	0
god's bread !	0
don’t make me wait for dinner even a moment .	0
you should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it .	0
and i as i love hastings with my heart .	0
with his eyes full of anger .	0
and i beseech you instantly to visit my too much changèd son .	0
i have done the state some service, and they know it.	0
know this much .	0
it’s partly my own fault ,  since i followed you here .	0
alack ,  there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords !	0
jove protect you well for this !	0
away, then!	0
good hamlet, cast thy nighted color off, and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark.	0
for god’s sake ,  shut up !	0
i do not like your faults .	0
my lord approaches .	0
with the handicap they’ve given me ,  i think i’ll win .	0
bring the villain out.	0
everything’s out of control .	0
come on and kiss me ,  kate .	0
who, he?	0
how is ’t ,  my noble lord ?	0
excellent !	0
i’m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .	0
o ,  that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace !	0
think’st thou ,  hortensio ,  though her father be very rich ,  any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ?	0
that island of england breeds very valiant creatures .	0
get thee away .	0
now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher’s heart—a small spark ,  all the rest on ’s body cold .	0
from there we’ll safely carry you to france and back ,  calming the waters of the channel to provide you with a smooth voyage .	0
tender yourself more dearly ,  or—not to crack the wind of the poor phrase ,  running it thus—you’ll tender me a fool .	0
god knows why ,  but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in westminster abbey .	0
when these prodigies do so conjointly meet ,  let not men say ,   “ these are their reasons .	0
let our reciprocal vows be remembered .	0
tis he .	0
oh ,  think’st thou we shall ever meet again ?	0
listen !	0
ha ,  banishment !	0
go ,  girl ,  look for a man who’ll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .	0
twas a rough night.	0
an eagle, madam, is not as green, as quick, and hasn’t so beautiful an eye as paris has.	0
come ,  good fellow ,  put thine iron on .	0
is the king stirring ,  worthy thane ?	0
there’s no clock here in the forest .	0
if it be thus to dream ,  still let me sleep !	0
farewell till then .	0
mixed it with dust ,  to which it is related .	0
so shalt thou show me friendship .	0
a thousand thousand !	0
lo ,  here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not washed off yet .	0
condemned villain, i do apprehend thee.	0
never quiet !	0
thou liest ,  abhorrèd tyrant .	0
i am provided of a torch-bearer.	0
pity me not ,  but lend thy serious hearing to what i shall unfold .	0
hamlet has polonius slain in insanity ,  and he has dragged him from his mother's bedroom .	0
my heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.	0
and you are come in very happy time to bear my greeting to the senators and tell them that i will not come today .	0
i leave you at once .	0
he used to praise his mother’s nipple before he sucked it .	0
what answer ,  sir ?	0
here comes the prince and claudio .	0
yes ,  it is ,  i think .	0
hate me!	0
draw ,  you rascal .	0
what on earth does that mean ?	0
with all my heart, and it doth much content me to hear him so inclin'd.	0
lepidus flatters both of them ,  as they flatter him ,  but he doesn’t love them ,  and they don’t love him .	0
the rapier and the dagger .	0
o thou good kent ,  how shall i live and work to match thy goodness ?	0
no ,  lovely princess .	0
let them all come down.	0
i have sent to find him and the body .	0
must i speak now ?	0
hang, dog, hang!	0
i hope you’re not trying to cheat me .	0
sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck ,  and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats ,  of breaches ,  ambuscadoes ,  spanish blades ,  of healths five fathom deep; and then anon drums in his ear ,  at which he starts and wakes ,  and being thus frighted ,  swears a prayer or two and sleeps again .	0
he poisons him i' the garden for his estate.	0
o gertrude, let’s go!	0
o caesar !	0
ay ,  and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .	0
it is safer to be what we destroy ,  rather than ,  by destruction ,  live in uncertain joy .	0
will you to scone?	0
malcolm, duncan’s son, from whom macbeth withholds his birthright, lives in the english court and is received by the most pious king edward with such grace that the evil twist of fate takes nothing from his high respect.	0
o dolt!	0
make room !	0
nay ,  but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed ,  stew'd in corruption ,  honeying and making love over the nasty sty !	0
bear hence this body ,  and attend our will .	0
good my lord !	0
we have met with foes that fight beside us .	0
true, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.	0
come over here; i am here.	0
i know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .	0
he's that he is .	0
neither heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.	0
my lord, as i was sewing in my closet, lord hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced, no hat upon his head, his stockings fouled, ungartered, and down-gyved to his ankle; pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, and with a look so piteous in purport as if he had been loosed out of hell to speak of horrors, he comes before me.	0
don’t doubt it, cassio, that i will have my lord and you as friendly again as you were.	0
when remedies are past, the griefs are ended by seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.	0
let me go in to see the generals.	0
is ’t true ,  is ’t true ?	0
good morning to you ,  friend .	0
that might be the case sir ,	0
oh ,  that i were a man for his sake !	0
young fortinbras ,  after conquering poland ,  gives this warlike volley to the ambassadors of england .	0
tis two or three ,  my lord ,  that bring you word macduff is fled to england .	0
that’s right .	0
strike ,  drum .	0
i am qualmish at the smell of leek .	0
a love song ,  a love song .	0
lead those away who will follow you ,  and we’ll explain publicly the reasons for caesar’s death .	0
what further woe conspires against mine age?	0
pardon me, good lady; for, by these blessed candles of the night, had you been there, i think, you would have begg'd the ring of me to give the worthy doctor.	0
a pound of man's flesh, taken from a man, is not so estimable, profitable neither, as flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats.	0
me marry her!	0
o ,  ho !	0
speak ,  if you can: what are you ?	0
i know not .	0
keep the men moving .	0
mine honor was not yielded ,  but conquered merely .	0
madam ,  that young man out there says he’s got to speak to you .	0
if he agrees ,  great .	0
how can these things in me seem like ridicule to you ,  when my tears prove them to be true ?	0
whither goest thou?	0
i do love it better than laughing .	0
but don’t go .	0
out, loathed medicine!	0
no, you'll reveal it.	0
what is your name ?	0
what ,  have you forgotten me ?	0
the moon sleeps with her lover, and does not want to be awakened!	0
do as i say .	0
that light is not daylight ,  i know it .	0
juliet wills it so .	0
that eye that told you so looked but asquint .	0
he could not have ’scaped sixpence a day .	0
he can’t give his house away to his daughters ,  leaving himself without shelter .	0
and like similar forecasters of fierce events, as the advance team before the fates, and prologue to the omen coming on, heaven and earth have together demonstrated to our country and countrymen.	0
is't possible ?	0
what ,  brutus ?	0
where’s your conscience now ?	0
speak ,  speak !	0
i think nothing, my lord.	0
grief of my son's exile has killed her .	0
who calls hamlet ?	0
you’ll get some of what you want .	0
by the lord, horatio, these three years i have noted that the age is grown so picky that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he hurts his feelings.	0
it rebels at this age ?	0
madam ,  he’s married to octavia .	0
o, who has done this deed?	0
then, window, let day in, and let life out.	0
here come two of duke senior’s pages .	0
but it is no matter .	0
o margaret ,  margaret ,  now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings' wretched head .	0
wouldst thou do such a thing for all the world?	0
what is pyramus ?	0
nothing .	0
sweet moon ,  i thank thee for thy sunny beams .	0
he pulls trinculo out from under caliban's cloak by the legs] thou art very trinculo indeed !	0
who would that be ?	0
the tears have gotten a small victory by that ,  my face was bad enough before my tears took their revenge .	0
oh god !	0
i will neither be faced nor braved .	0
saw who ?	0
villain and he be many miles asunder.	0
what are you going to do ?	0
now ,  infidel ,  i have thee on the hip .	0
censure me in your wisdom ,  and awake your senses that you may the better judge .	0
i spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .	0
not because we love words better ,  as you do .	0
only, peace!	0
ay . —fare you well ,  fair gentleman .	0
do so, good messala.	0
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother’s admiration ?	0
but no more sights ! —where are these gentlemen ?	0
tell me .	0
pretty!	0
i had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire .	0
faith, the rumor goes that you shall marry her.	0
hero that is dead !	0
give me your arm .	0
and how is she doing?	0
but for one reason they refused to execute her .	0
come on ,  trinculo ,  let us sing .	0
master ,  master ,  look about you .	0
within a month, before the salt of the most wicked tears had left the redness in her bitter eyes, she married.	0
we are haunted .	0
even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home ,  they cannot escape god .	0
here ,  my lord .	0
take a trumpet ,  herald .	0
for i have neither wit nor words nor worth ,  action nor utterance nor the power of speech ,  to stir men’s blood .	0
he who chooses me will get what many men want .  ”  what many men want—that  “ many ”  could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy .	0
therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature; or if not so, then here i hit it right— our romeo hath not been in bed to-night.	0
be by ,  good madam ,  when we do awake him .	0
so i did ,  fearing to strengthen that impatience which seem'd too much enkindled ,  and withal hoping it was but an effect of humor ,  which sometime hath his hour with every man .	0
will you go on?	0
what’s up ,  mister ?	0
within my tent his bones tonight shall lie most like a soldier ,  ordered honorably .	0
that they were ,  i wish myself were mudded in that oozy bed where my son lies . —when did you lose your daughter ?	0
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood .	0
it is here !	0
here lies the water, good.	0
then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !	0
you speak your whole part all at once, cues, and all.—pyramus enter.	0
think you not that the powers we bear with us will cut their passage through the force of france ,  doing the execution and the act for which we have in head assembled them ?	0
i want you there and back again before i can even tell you what you should do there .	0
is there more toil?	0
think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak when power to flattery bows ?	0
o heavens, this is my true-begotten father!	0
what do you mean?	0
confess and love ”  had been the very sum of my confession .	0
sweet lady ,  you have given me life and living ,  because here i read for certain that my ships have safely come home .	0
have you heard the story?	0
custom hath made it in him a property of easiness .	0
here .	0
well, in that hit, you miss.	0
have at thee, coward!	0
villain am i none.	0
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers; and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.	0
at such a time i'll loose my daughter to him.	0
why ,  what would you ?	0
if you don’t mind ,  i need to rest a bit .	0
o ,  i cry you mercy !	0
what is it?	0
if what you say is true ,  you can do the same to me .	0
legged like a man ,  and his fins like arms !	0
poor lady ,  she'll run mad when she shall lack it .	0
it is .	0
the funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables .	0
come hither; i am here.	0
i’m sure everything will be fine .	0
lord ,  what though ?	0
thy husband knew it all .	0
ha!	0
do you not know me ,  father ?	0
fie ,  fie ,  thou shamest thy shape ,  thy love ,  thy wit ,  which ,  like a usurer ,  abound’st in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape ,  thy love ,  thy wit .	0
i have had it, and soundly too.	0
you lie.	0
i’ll not expostulate with her ,  lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again—this night ,  iago !	0
tell the constable .	0
it’s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .	0
then, since that’s the story as it stands now, i think it best for you to marry the count.	0
what says the silver, with her virgin hue?	0
nay ,  stay and hear me speak .	0
whereon old norway ,  overcome with joy ,	0
i am not sorry neither .	0
was it you that he rescued ?	0
i have it ready for you; here it is .	0
is it your dear friend that is in trouble like this?	0
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, absent thee from felicity awhile, and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, to tell my story.	0
give him this money and these notes ,  reynaldo .	0
not now .	0
before me !	0
i beseech you pardon me ,  my lord ,  if i be mistaken—for my duty cannot be silent when i think your highness wronged .	0
poor souls ,  they perished .	0
she desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed .	0
is ’t possible ?	0
you may be rightly just, whatever i shall think.	0
but as it is ,  we can’t dismiss him: he makes our fire ,  fetches in our wood; and serves in jobs that are to our advantage . —what hey !	0
i should be still plucking the grass ,  to know where sits the wind; peering in maps ,  for ports ,  and piers ,  and roads: and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures ,  out of doubt would make me sad .	0
who is to be buried in't?	0
he won’t see my face ever again .	0
my letters say only seventy senators were killed ,  one being cicero .	0
may not one speak ?	0
what do these noisy storms care about the name of king ?	0
here it is ,  i think .	0
it is not nighttime now .	0
nymph, in your eyes may all my sins be remembered.	0
you speak truly; it is so ,  indeed .	0
i warrant you ,  sir ,  the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardor of my liver .	0
the time is come .	0
why do you ask ?	0
this precious little guy is putty in your hands ,  sir toby .	0
one kiss, and i'll descend.	0
but i have words that would be howl'd out in the desert air ,  where hearing should not latch them .	0
often ,  when i’m dulled by worry and melancholy ,  he lightens my mood with his merry pranks .	0
but who’s here ? —lysander !	0
and so they are .	0
in god’s name ,  i beg you not to wish for one more man .	0
this is the monkey's own giving out .	0
i will give you the minstrel .	0
speak, i command you.	0
if your majesty would like ,  i’ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like .	0
i will go out .	0
what’s wrong?	0
pale as your smock!	0
i hear my father coming .	0
good gentlemen, give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights.	0
nothing will come of nothing .	0
man is but an ass if he go about to expound this methought i was—there is no man can tell what dream .	0
i don’t dare come down—forgive me ,  my lord—i don’t dare ,  for fear of capture .	0
every man is on his own for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself, because all is only fortune.—coragio!	0
thus high ,  by thy advice and thy assistance is king richard seated .	0
not tonight ,  iago .	0
dead!	0
there’s rosemary ,  that’s for remembrance .	0
but you ,  o you ,  so perfect and so peerless ,  are created of every creature's best !	0
they’re all ready to eat dinner .	0
if you lie ,  boy ,  we’ll have you whipped .	0
yes, that he was.	0
the motions of his spirit are dull as night ,  and his affections dark as erebus .	0
take him safely through the lines .	0
tell them so ,  decius .	0
what do you mean ,   “ in a strange way ”  ?	0
will it eat me ?	0
eighty dollars !	0
well demanded ,  wench; my tale provokes that question .	0
they’ll tell all .	0
it’s nearly dinner time ,  and the night’s going to be wasted .	0
look, my lord, it comes!	0
then the wrong man is dead ,  and sweet revenge has gone wrong .	0
look, here she comes.	0
i can no more .	0
and i .	0
if he distaste it ,  let him to our sister ,  whose mind and mine i know in that are one ,  not to be overruled .	0
what ?	0
follow that lord ,  and look you mock him not .	0
when he came to himself again ,  he said ,  if he had done or said anything amiss ,  he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity .	0
heavens rain grace on that which grows between them !	0
you cannot ,  sir ,  take from me any thing that i will more willingly part withal—except my life ,  except my life ,  except my life .	0
o stephano ,  two neapolitans escaped !	0
you’ll be afraid to hear it .	0
well, there has been a lot of comment on both sides, and the nation holds it no sin to provoke them to controversy.	0
this treachery of yours is like the second	0
thou know'st that banquo and his fleance lives .	0
it is the poison'd cup; it is too late .	0
why ,  all our ranks are broke .	0
do so ,  and bid my sweet prepare to chide .	0
is there division 'twixt my lord and cassio ?	0
come in out of the storm .	0
i have no wife .	0
till i shall see you in your soldiers’ dress ,  which will become you both ,  farewell .	0
they made more money and got more attention in the city .	0
there's never a villain dwelling in all denmark except that he's an arrant knave.	0
sings drunkenly] farewell ,  master ,  farewell ,  farewell !	0
he’s welcome here .	0
o ,  but she'll keep her word .	0
didn’t great caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?	0
please ,  is my master returned yet ?	0
tybalt, mercutio, the prince expressly hath forbid this bandying in verona streets.	0
my husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.	0
why, then it is not a prison to you, for there is nothing either good or bad but only thinking makes it so.	0
nay, but he prated and spoke such scurvy and provoking terms against your honor that, with the little godliness i have, i did full hard forbear him.	0
my wife!	0
out of my sight !	0
let’s speak to him .	0
o villain ,  thou hast stolen both mine office and my name !	0
no ?	0
let me go .	0
this [aside] why speaks my father so urgently?	0
i have letters that say the same thing.	0
no ,  not for all of venice .	0
o husband!	0
as you on him ,  demetrius dote on you !	0
that’s how claudio will respond .	0
go now ,  lord constable and all you princes ,  and quickly bring us news of england’s defeat .	0
what's the news?	0
methinks i see thee, now thou art below, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.	0
here’s mine .	0
dear my lord ,  make me acquainted with your cause of grief .	0
o tybalt ,  tybalt ,  the best friend i had !	0
it’s almost five o'clock .	0
these are news indeed !	0
come ,  montague; for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down .	0
had he his hurts before ?	0
you won’t enjoy it much ,  i can tell you ,  the odds are so against this young man .	0
you’ll have to woo bianca like the rest .	0
othello ,  have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you .	0
answer me that first .	0
you could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .	0
and shall our lively blood ,  quickened by wine ,  be so frosty ?	0
what i am, truly, is your and my poor country's to command, where, indeed, before you came here, old siward, with ten thousand warlike men already at a point, was coming to.	0
the clock struck nine when i sent the nurse; she promised to return in half an hour.	0
the strangeness of your story made me very sleepy.	0
an old italian fox is never that generous ,  my boy .	0
hath she made her affection known to benedick ?	0
now ,  good angels preserve the king .	0
here is a sick man that would speak with you.	0
he doesn’t know yet about his honorable fortune .	0
there he will come to know his destiny.	0
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.	0
where ?	0
is your englishman so expert in his drinking ?	0
yes ,  that’s it !	0
i see you’re all eaten up with emotion .	0
i never sued to friend ,  nor enemy; my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word .	0
i’m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .	0
i’m not holding your hand ,  sir .	0
i will ,  sir .	0
then ,  lord have mercy on me !	0
come, sir, get going.	0
and you ,  sir ,  what’s  well ,  compared to a fine workman ,  you might call me a mere cobbler .	0
that last is true—the sweeter rest was mine .	0
say these bitter things to your bitter foe .	0
how ,  in one house ,  should many people under two commands hold amity ?	0
you speak with all your wit, and yet, in faith, with wit enough for you.	0
here is better than the open air .	0
i see ,  sir ,  you are liberal in offers: you taught me first to beg; and now ,  methinks ,  you teach me how a beggar should be answer'd .	0
it is clean out of the way .	0
surely ,  a princely testimony ,  a goodly count ,  count comfect ,  a sweet gallant ,  surely !	0
i cannot drink too much of brutus' love .	0
here, peter quince.	0
who ,  me ?	0
i will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him .	0
what said he when he came unto himself?	0
my dear lord ,  if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity— i know what you’re about to say .	0
but so much was our love we would not understand what was most fit, but, like the owner of a foul disease, to keep it from divulging, let it feed even on the pith of life.	0
i sent him away ,  and gave him a good excuse for your fit; i told him to come back soon and speak here with me; which he promised to do .	0
oh ,  stephano ,  two men from naples survived !	0
but brutus says he was ambitious ,  and brutus is an honorable man .	0
o ,  be some other name !	0
nor the soles of her shoe?	0
if i could colonize this island ,  my lord— he’d cultivate weeds on it .	0
but who’s coming ?	0
out on her ,  hilding !	0
be kind and courteous to this gentleman; hop in his walks ,  and gambol in his eyes; feed him with apricocks and dewberries ,  with purple grapes ,  green figs ,  and mulberries; the honey - bags steal from the humble - bees ,  and for night - tapers crop their waxen thighs ,  and light them at the fiery glow - worm's eyes ,  to have my love to bed and to arise; and pluck the wings from painted butterflies ,  to fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes .	0
o ,  she would laugh me out of myself ,  press me to death with wit .	0
what’s wrong ,  hecate ?	0
to what base uses we may return ,  horatio .	0
gallus ,  go you along .	0
the poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.	0
he is a sailmaker in bergamo .	0
the noble brutus told you that caesar was ambitious .	0
you’ll ask me why i rather choose to have a weight of carrion flesh than to receive three thousand ducats .	0
where is my lady ?	0
why then i think cassio's an honest man .	0
is it come to this ?	0
at lovers' lies ,  they say jove laughs .	0
there's many a beast, then, in a crowded city, and many a civil monster.	0
i shall faint .	0
here hung those lips that i have kissed i know not how oft.	0
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen and get her leave to part .	0
why ?	0
demetrius loves her, and he doesn’t love you.	0
is rosaline ,  that thou didst love so dear ,  so soon forsaken ?	0
my lord ,  on the platform where we watched .	0
i am launcelot ,  your boy that was ,  your son that is ,  your child that shall be .	0
why, i beg you?	0
and i came with him .	0
but as for now—before two weeks have gone by ,  i’m going to send some people packing .	0
now ,  we go contentedly to freedom—not banishment .	0
come ,  friar francis ,  be brief ,  only to the plain form of marriage ,  and you shall recount their particular duties afterwards .	0
nor i .  i would not live there ,  to put my father into violent thoughts ,  by being always in his sight .	0
they shall be apprehended by and by .	0
malcolm !	0
my lord shall never rest; i'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; his bed shall seem a school ,  his board a shrift; i'll intermingle everything he does with cassio's suit .	0
hippolyta ,  i woo'd thee with my sword ,  and won thy love doing thee injuries; but i will wed thee in another key ,  with pomp ,  with triumph ,  and with revelling .	0
i’m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .	0
say to the king the knowledge of the broil as thou didst leave it .	0
please stand up !	0
yes ,  sir .	0
thou 'lt be afraid to hear it .	0
ye men of cyprus, let her have your knees.	0
nothing ,  my lord .	0
i shall win at the odds .	0
it’s fair game to mark a coward .	0
i was so crazy myself that i forgot all about him .	0
so awake when i am gone; for i must now to oberon .	0
yes ,  my lord .	0
o ye immortal gods!	0
oh ,  antonio ,  i’m sorry i caused you so much trouble .	0
a fig !	0
they are .	0
o ,  give me thy hand ,  one writ with me in sour misfortune's book !	0
more validity, more honourable state, more courtship lives in carrion flies than romeo.	0
he shall not live; look, with a spot i damn him.	0
our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .	0
oh ,  wise and upright judge ,  how much more older are you than your looks !	0
i’ll see no more .	0
like this ,  sir: although this lord of weak memory ,  this man who shall be remembered little when he is buried ,  here has almost persuaded , — because he's a spirit of persuasion ,  only he professes to persuade , —the king’s son is alive ,  it is as impossible that he's not drowned as he who sleeps here swims .	0
no ,  though thou call’st thyself a hotter name than any is in hell .	0
nay ,  heaven doth know .	0
let me have surgeons .	0
my lord ,  i came to see your father's funeral .	0
the dictator, custom, very grave senators, has made the stone and steel couch of war my feather bed three times.	0
yet ,  forgive me ,  god ,  that i do brag thus .	0
were you dreaming ,  lucius ?	0
in one voyage, claribel found her husband at tunis, and ferdinand, her brother, found a wife where he himself was lost; prospero found his dukedom in a poor island; and all of us found ourselves, when no man was in his right minds.	0
we’re available .	0
sir ,  i say to you we are none .	0
no more than i am well released from .	0
a loud - mouthed ,  drunken monster .	0
was ever man so beaten ?	0
as dumb as dirt !	0
well ,  get thee gone .	0
i want the law ,  the penalty ,  and the fulfillment of my contract .	0
you slave ,  you cur !	0
nay, how will you do for a husband?	0
i did consent, and often did beguile her of her tears when i did speak of some distressful stroke that my youth suffer'd.	0
the king is getting up .	0
i'll find either death or you immediately.	0
pardon me, julius!	0
madam ,  i'll leave .	0
pray you ,  tread softly ,  that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall .	0
speak ,  is it missing ?	0
oh ,  i’m very scared something awful has happened .	0
no ,  let's follow him .	0
i come to fetch you to the senate-house.	0
pluck up thy spirits .	0
i gave my love a ring, and made him swear never to part with it; and here he stands,— i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it, nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth that the world masters.	0
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd in evils to top macbeth.	0
give me your love instead ,  as i give you mine .	0
he’ll never follow anything that other men have started .	0
how does the queen?	0
what good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?	0
with him?	0
come ,  come ,  the reason .	0
who calls me villain?	0
well ,  but what’s o'clock ?	0
for lead ?	0
that is done, sir; they have all stomachs.	0
sir ,  grieve not you .	0
meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowed grave, being the time the potion's force should cease.	0
blister'd be thy tongue for such a wish !	0
for who is living, if those two are gone?	0
that last is true—the sweeter rest was mine.	0
have a seat .	0
imagination!	0
is my master and his wife coming ,  grumio ?	0
be aidant and remediate in the good man’s distress .	0
he’s not telling the truth .	0
they will surely do us no harm .	0
you still haven’t said anything incriminating .	0
and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .	0
no offense i' th' world .	0
i commend your pains ,  and every one shall share i' th' gains .	0
a wandering knight ?	0
when i was with him ,  i heard him swear to tubal and to chus ,  his countrymen ,  that he would rather have antonio's flesh than twenty times the value of the sum that he owed him; and i know ,  my lord ,  if law ,  authority ,  and power ,  don’t deny him ,  it will go hard with poor antonio .	0
romeo !	0
i didn’t tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .	0
you were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks ,  which your modesties have not craft enough to colour .	0
here !	0
there’s dolabella ,  who was sent from caesar .	0
if i took the kingdom from your sons ,  i’ll give it to your daughter to make up for it .	0
hark ,  petruchio: she says she’ll see thee hanged first .	0
done what ,  my good lord ?	0
macduff is missing, and your noble son.	0
thou'lt be afraid to hear it.	0
romeo killed tybalt .	0
villain ,  be sure thou prove my love a whore; be sure of it .	0
didn’t you lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia ,  the girl he had just raped ?	0
the treacherous instrument is in thy hand ,  unbated and envenomed .	0
i’ll have to ask you some questions ,  madam .	0
why then ,  resolve me whether you will or no .	0
is ’t true ?	0
welcome .	0
hey !	0
poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.	0
your tributary drops belong to woe ,  which you ,  mistaking ,  offer up to joy .	0
thy master is a wise and valiant roman; i never thought him worse .	0
will the king hear this piece of work?	0
she is dead .	0
greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!	0
love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs; being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes; being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers’ tears.	0
were we before our armies ,  and to fight ,  i should do thus .	0
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .	0
he that sweetest rose will find must find love’s prick ,  and rosalind .	0
god forbid he wants to challenge me !	0
thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft ,  and wit depends on dilatory time .	0
i’ll drink for you .	0
enobarbus ,  antony has sent you all your treasure ,  with generous gifts besides .	0
no boasting like a fool; this deed i'll do before this purpose cool .	0
rome ,  thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods !	0
look at this ,  here is the man—scarred ,  as you can see ,  by traitors .	0
aside] fair meeting of two most rare loves!	0
go on, and don’t leave any ritual out.	0
yes, she really did.	0
give me thy hand .	0
yield up ,  o love ,  thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate !	0
twill not he seen in him there.	0
confusion's cure doesn’t live in these confusions .	0
the hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds of wide arabia are as thoroughfares now for princes to come view fair portia .	0
she speaks daggers ,  and every word stabs .	0
i'll send my prayers with him.	0
yes ,  by saint anne ,  and ginger shall be hot i' the mouth too .	0
sir ,  sir ,  sir—	0
when the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew, but for the sunset of my brother's son it rains downright.	0
although many people said she looked like me ,  she was considered beautiful .	0
tis hamlet's character .	0
why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?	0
my noble kinsman ,  welcome .	0
but now, my lord, what say you to my suit?	0
i crave the law ,  the penalty ,  and forfeit of my bond .	0
i pray ,  sir ,  tell me ,  is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold ?	0
or as ’twere perfumed by a fen.	0
but not by him !	0
now i am in debt to my enemy .	0
where should we go ?	0
hide fox, and all after.	0
lucius ! —fast asleep ?	0
no place will please me so ,  no mean of death ,  as here by caesar ,  and by you cut off ,  the choice and master spirits of this age .	0
oh my god ,  they have run away and left me asleep !	0
so ,  what’s the news on the rialto ?	0
what’s this part for ?	0
tis since the nuptial of lucentio ,  come pentecost as quickly as it will ,  some five - and - twenty years ,  and then we mask'd .	0
yes, a thousand times.	0
give me some light !	0
before the time i did lysander see ,  seem'd athens as a paradise to me .	0
now curse my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied !	0
the letters that he speaks of  may be my friends .	0
what time is it now ?	0
but i have words that would be howled out into the desert air, where hearing should not catch them.	0
we'll rebel .	0
a torch for me!	0
come ,  brother; away !	0
i cry you gentle pardon; these bloody accidents must excuse my manners ,  that so neglected you .	0
and let her speak of me before her father .	0
what will you do for her ?	0
where ,  where ?	0
put this poison into any liquid you want, and drink it all; and, if you had the strength of twenty men, it would kill you right away.	0
what ?	0
i once more take my leave .	0
dost thou hear ,  lady ?	0
sweet bodements !	0
o monstrous world !	0
they did entreat me to acquaint her of it ,  but i persuaded them ,  if they loved benedick ,  to wish him wrestle with affection and never to let beatrice know of it .	0
if we actors have offended you, think about this,--and everything will be all right,--you have only dozed off here while these visions appeared.	0
why, don’t you see it?	0
there to meet with macbeth.	0
bleed ,  bleed ,  poor country !	0
he rests tonight within twenty - one miles of rome .	0
god bless you .	0
you have nothing to be afraid of ,  my lord; i’ll do it .	0
he's having a fit now and doesn’t talk sense.	0
i’m not interested in being good .	0
her dotage now i do begin to pity .	0
so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me .	0
i wish your ladyship all my heart's content .	0
are you wise ?	0
are we all ready?	0
actually, sweet love, i was just coming to your house.	0
a baubling vessel was he captain of ,  for shallow draught and bulk unprizable ,  with which such scathful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet ,  that very envy and the tongue of loss cried fame and honor on him . —what’s the matter ?	0
i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts ,  but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case ,  if i refuse to wed demetrius .	0
i am no sea captain ,  but ,  if you were as far away as that vast shore washed with the furthest sea ,  i would risk everything for such a cargo .	0
did you say caesar fainted ?	0
why i should fear, i don’t know, since i don’t know guiltiness, but yet i feel i fear.	0
love doesn’t look with the eyes ,  but with the mind; and that’s why cupid is painted with a blindfold .	0
aside.	0
we must die ,  messala .	0
you should know this: much luck is on my side ,  and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island .	0
pardon me ,  caesar ,  for my dear dear love to your proceeding bids me tell you this ,  and reason to my love is liable .	0
commend me to thy lady ,  and bid her hasten all the house to bed ,  which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .	0
i am not of many words ,  but i thank you .	0
my cousin tells him in his ear that he is in her heart .	0
and i do not doubt but to hear them say ,   “ it is a sweet comedy .  ”  no more words .	0
how many goodly creatures are there here !	0
oh ,  i know .	0
spirits ,  which by mine art i have from their confines called to enact my present fancies .	0
i have a daughter .	0
here comes one.	0
pay him six thousand and deface the bond !	0
what ,  not a whore ?	0
wilt thou at ninny's tomb meet me straightway ?	0
how poor are they that have not patience!	0
come, come, the reason.	0
romeo must not live .	0
if i had the mind to think about all this, and if i lacked the mind to see that such a thing could happen, wouldn’t it make me sad?	0
and joy is welcomed in such a needy time.	0
the world affords no law to make thee rich .	0
god’s bodykins ,  man ,  much better .	0
by mary ,  our play is—the most lamentable comedy and most cruel death of pyramus and thisbe .	0
why ,  'tis a loving and a fair reply .	0
what o'clock tomorrow shall i send to thee ?	0
to know what my errand is ,  madam .	0
i found it in my bedroom.	0
i think it can be no other reason but that.	0
is he not here ?	0
you look pale ,  and gaze ,  and put on fear ,  and cast yourself in wonder to see the strange impatience of the heavens .	0
why ,  madam ,  if i were your father’s dog ,  you should not use me so .	0
what a tedious wait !	0
may god in heaven bless you .	0
and, for as the first installment of a greater honor, he ordered me, from him, to call you baron of cawdor.	0
look you here, here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.	0
now is the sun upon the highest hill of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve is three long hours, yet she’s not back.	0
oh ,  me !	0
it is my wretched luck .	0
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabb'd caesar; i do fear it .	0
i'll show you the best springs; i'll pluck you berries; i'll fish for you ,  and get you enough wood .	0
m ” —malvolio .	0
not i, my lord.	0
nor go neither .	0
let him fly far .	0
you haven’t got dreams or fantasies which busy care draws in the brains of men .	0
welcome, gentlemen!	0
shall it be tonight at supper ?	0
i will look for the king .	0
we really like this news, and later when we have more time we'll read this request, answer, and think upon this business.	0
don’t even think about refusing .	0
every old man has worries ,  and worried men never get any sleep ,  but young men shouldn’t have a care in the world .	0
you may call me that ,  sir ,  when i may be a wife .	0
i’d like to munch on some good dry oats .	0
here’s france and burgundy ,  my noble lord .	0
hey, hey!	0
are you scared ?	0
yes ,  and wisely too; because it would have angered any heart alive ,  to hear the men deny it .	0
i never thought him worse .	0
nay ,  do not pause; for i did kill king henry— but ’twas thy beauty that provokèd me .	0
if it be true that good wine needs no bush ,  ’tis true that a good play needs no epilogue .	0
as for michael cassio ,  i think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest .	0
old montague is here ,  and he’s waving his sword around just to make me mad .	0
good gentlemen ,  give him a further edge and drive his purpose on to these delights .	0
she wants to speak with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .	0
i have to make do .	0
i wish i had been there .	0
and that were much he should ,  for he is given to sports ,  to wildness ,  and much company .	0
by what, in the name of god?	0
cassio’s my worthy friend— my lord ,  i see you’re moved .	0
tis an unweeded garden that grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature possess it merely .	0
ay ,  and wisely too ,  for ’twould have anger'd any heart alive to hear the men deny't .	0
he made you for a highway to my bed; but i, a maid, die maiden-widowed.	0
why ,  that the moor first gave to desdemona ,  that which so often you did bid me steal .	0
you wrong me more ,  sir ,  in denying it .	0
i’ll speak to them ,  and then tonight i’ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds .	0
evil earth ,  die; end all motion here; and you and romeo lay in a heavy tomb !	0
it sorts well with your fierceness .	0
be near at hand; i may miscarry in't.	0
why ,  there then !	0
good—here’s the stretcher .	0
i just saw your father the lord gloucester and notified him that the duke of cornwall and his wife regan will stay with him here tonight .	0
turn around ,  you dog from hell ,  turn around !	0
will you marry her ?	0
yours, yours.	0
go, nurse, go with her.	0
no ,  boy .	0
don’t let your ears hate what i’m going to say forever ,  which will hit them with the heaviest sound that they have ever heard .	0
you know i gave it you even now .	0
i take ’t ’tis later ,  sir .	0
oh ,  my lord ,  what do you mean by that ?	0
warm, honestly!	0
advise yourself .	0
i'll to him; he is hid at laurence’ cell.	0
the reason why the seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason .	0
mark it.	0
go on !	0
a roman .	0
this, casca; this, cinna; and this, metellus cimber.	0
you shouldn’t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .	0
he ran out that way ,  sir ,  when he couldn’t— follow him ,  now !	0
sir ,  we were discussing how our garments now seem as fresh as they were when we were at the wedding of your daughter ,  who is now queen ,  in tunis .	0
to the breach ,  to the breach !	0
deceiving me” is thisbe's cue.	0
lysander, if you live, good sir, wake up!	0
my lord ?	0
am i a married man or a bachelor ?	0
you speak too bitterly .	0
octavius ,  lead your battle softly on ,  upon the left hand of the even field .	0
you are really putting your virginity at risk ,  to leave the city ,  and surrender yourself to the hands of someone who doesn’t love you ,  to go night thinking that nothing can happen ,  and to come to a deserted place ,  with something as rich as your virginity .	0
but don’t think i’m doing this because i’m greedy .	0
follow my voice; we won’t test your manhood here .	0
why, i can buy me twenty at any market.	0
let us bear him  to th’ court of guard .	0
here comes newer comfort.	0
if there are any, speak, because i have offended him.	0
do you smell something naughty ?	0
what !	0
ay ,  pilgrim ,  lips that they must use in prayer .	0
o worthy stephano !	0
ride ,  ride ,  messala .	0
alas, he is betrayed, and i have no hope!	0
o villainous!	0
no ,  fair princess .	0
someone knocks .	0
i shall attend you presently at your tent .	0
well ,  let’s watch it .	0
then murder 's out of tune, and sweet revenge grows harsh.	0
she that doth call me husband ,  even my soul doth for a wife abhor .	0
what is there left to do ?	0
how are you, my lord!	0
words ,  words ,  words .	0
i am a tainted wether of the flock ,  meetest for death .	0
i shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a christian .	0
you lie .	0
you insolent rascal ,  what trade ?	0
awake!	0
into my grave ?	0
thou art a scholar; speak to it ,  horatio .	0
when he is gone, i would like to speak with you urgently.	0
i won’t fight you .	0
nothing at all, yet all that i see is.	0
if not ,  you can kill me .	0
the testament !	0
the constable of france .	0
pitiful day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!	0
oh ,  the poor man !	0
did he get away clean ?	0
in any other case, he is.	0
no .	0
great happiness !	0
if you really love me ,  you’ll find me . —nerissa and the rest of you ,  get away from him .	0
god ,  we are her privates .	0
but ,  look you ,  cassius ,  the angry spot doth glow on caesar's brow ,  and all the rest look like a chidden train: calpurnia's cheek is pale ,  and cicero looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes as we have seen him in the capitol ,  being cross'd in conference by some senators .	0
it was the nightingale ,  and not the lark ,  that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .	0
she creeps .	0
his knights grow riotous ,  and himself upbraids us on every trifle .	0
how silent is this town !	0
then by your side no bed room me deny .	0
you make your knife sharp ,  not on the sole of your shoe ,  but on your soul ,  harsh jew ,  but no metal can ,  no ,  not the hangman's axe ,  be sharpened to half the sharpness of your sharp hate .	0
captain macmorris ,  i think ,  look you ,  under your correction ,  there is not many of your nation—  of my nation ?	0
wilt come?	0
no ,  son .	0
do you win ,  roman ?	0
didn’t i turn down the page where i left off reading ?	0
for your broken shin .	0
o ,  what a noble mind here is conquered !	0
to prison until the right time of law and course of justice call you to answer .	0
is it sport ?	0
others there are, who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage.	0
thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform ,  and i must use you in such another trick .	0
get going; away!	0
better macbeth than such an one to reign.	0
oh ,  damn you ,  stubborn dog !	0
down with the montagues !	0
you are a lover; borrow cupid's wings, and use them to soar above that leaden soul.	0
we are blest that rome is rid of him .	0
not as happy as macbeth, only still much happier.	0
now heaven has her .	0
we’re lucky that rome is rid of him .	0
six cents a-day in pyramus, or nothing.	0
how ?	0
now ,  where’s my wife ?	0
keep word ,  lysander; we must starve our sight from lovers' food till morrow deep midnight .	0
look how shapely your legs are .	0
but why couldn’t i say  “ amen ”  ?	0
my reputation ,  iago ,  my reputation !	0
my face i’ll grime with filth ,  blanket my loins ,  elf all my hair in knots ,  and with presented nakedness outface the winds and persecutions of the sky .	0
the more i love him, the more he hates me.	0
it is a reeling world indeed ,  my lord ,  and i believe will never stand upright till richard wear the garland of the realm .	0
well ,  i’m not sorry to hear that ,  because they have always been my enemies .	0
you think about him too much .	0
declare thine office .	0
to ,  to ,  to— to murder me ?	0
oh!	0
why ,  bride !	0
the gentleman that danced with her told her she is much wronged by you .	0
wilt thou lay hands on me ,  villain ?	0
i know that she is worthy of that love .	0
sir ,  that’s well said and well thought out .	0
listen to me ,  because i’m older than you ,  surely .	0
lady beatrice ,  have you wept all this while ?	0
stand ,  ho !	0
haven’t you made your other love ,  demetrius—who kicked me with his foot not long ago—call me a goddess and a divine ,  rare ,  precious ,  heavenly creature ?	0
ay, and wisely too, for ’twould have anger'd any heart alive to hear the men deny't.	0
lend me a garter .	0
fiend angelical !	0
i pray you ,  dissuade him from her .	0
saw you the weird sisters?	0
no, this was only his dream.	0
oh my fair warrior !	0
fine ,  i' faith !	0
why do we party until we’re like animals ?	0
come ,  mistress kate ,  i’ll join you .	0
what hath he said ?	0
answer every man directly .	0
and what hope is that, please?	0
yes ,  a dozen ,  and as many to the vantage as would store the world they played for .	0
what would i do besides good ?	0
and will you have me ?	0
if you won’t leave ,  then	0
and so far i am glad it worked out this way ,  because i am really enjoying the show .	0
let’s go find that hussy ,  fortune ,  and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .	0
i say i will make him eat some part of my leek ,  or i will peat his pate four days . —bite ,  i pray you .	0
when you fight against your country’s enemies ,  you will be paid for your efforts with your country’s wealth .	0
i dare damnation .	0
you know the rendezvous .	0
amen ,  with all my heart .	0
o scotland, scotland!	0
why ,  would that have mended my hair ?	0
to his wife) don’t hold me back – let me go !	0
i am not gamesome .	0
amen!	0
you are the best of the cutthroats .	0
tomorrow is wednesday.	0
you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself .	0
i’ll serve this duke .	0
yes ,  that he was .	0
am i come near ye now ?	0
your love says, like an honest gentleman, “where is your mother?”’ o god's lady dear!	0
i thank you ,  doctor .	0
what a drunken imbecile is this!	0
abhorrèd slave ,  which any print of goodness wilt not take ,  being capable of all ill !	0
will she go now to bed ?	0
please don’t be offended that i don’t want to offend you any more .	0
how can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?	0
he will stay till you come .	0
is ’t not the king ?	0
never did mockers waste more idle breath .	0
if you had known the virtue of the ring ,  or half her worthiness that gave the ring ,  or your own honour to contain the ring ,  you would not then have parted with the ring .	0
a fair name .	0
i could find it in my heart to beat him,— come, kiss.	0
here is more news.	0
a friend of antony's.	0
there’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned .	0
iago ?	0
how will you live ?	0
where is he?	0
where are my slippers ?	0
widow!	0
my lord, i did; but answer made it none.	0
sit ,  jessica .	0
if they see you ,  they’ll murder you .	0
please ,  let’s go and find out where he is ,  and help burn up his tangled depression with some delight or other .	0
it’s a bet !	0
the devil speaks in him .	0
what’s the matter?	0
hey !	0
now ,  roderigo ,  where didst thou see her ? —oh ,  unhappy girl ! — with the moor ,  say’st thou ? —who would be a father ? — how didst thou know ’twas she ? —oh ,  she deceives me past thought ! —what said she to you ? —get more tapers ,  raise all my kindred .	0
how cheerest thou ,  jessica ?	0
the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake .	0
methought i was enamour'd of an ass .	0
i wish it were over .	0
or are you low ,  vulgar ,  and of the common people ?	0
michael, good night.	0
this is the truth ,  or let benvolio die .	0
tis too late to go to bed now .	0
by the end i will either live ,  or else i’ll restore my honor by shedding my blood .	0
what does this mean ,  my lord ?	0
i hope that’s all he loses .	0
is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt?	0
my lord ,  please go inside here .	0
i hope so .	0
and pick a fight with my own shadow?	0
i am no more mad than you are .	0
he looks calmer than he did before .	0
i know his trumpet .	0
again  “ banished ?  ”  stop with the philosophy !	0
what news?	0
to the boatswain] now ,  [to the boatswain] now ,  blasphemy ,  that swear'st grace o'erboard: not an oath on shore ?	0
i wish it were day !	0
i’ll have my lessons in the order and manner	0
and sowing the kernels of it in the sea ,  bring forth more islands .	0
pretending ?	0
how smooth and even they do bear themselves ,  as if allegiance in their bosoms sat crownèd with faith and constant loyalty .	0
you’re my true and honorable wife, as dear to me as are the red tears that visit my sad heart.	0
i must be circumstanced .	0
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary cock -  pigeon over his hen ,  more clamorous than a parrot against rain ,  more newfangled than an ape ,  more giddy in my desires than a monkey .	0
as the sonnet says ,   “ if you please one special person ,  you please everyone who matters .  ”  why ,  what’s going on ?	0
why ,  what are you ?	0
clubs ,  pikes ,  and more pikes !	0
o ,  be gone !	0
take off my armor .	0
i desire your more acquaintance, good master mustardseed.	0
what ,  you egg !	0
if thou didst ever hold me in thy heart ,  absent thee from felicity awhile ,  and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain ,  to tell my story .	0
i have it ready for you; here it is.	0
o, be some other name!	0
knock you here ,  sir ?	0
faith ,  some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .	0
what ,  wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?	0
o harry’s wife ,  triumph not in my woes !	0
what treasure had he, my lord?	0
marvellous sweet music!	0
saint valentine’s day is past; do these forest-birds begin only now to make a couple?	0
calling death ‘banishment , ’ thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe and smilest upon the stroke that murders me .	0
romans ,  countrymen ,  and lovers !	0
look ,  how he laughs already !	0
shall they see us?	0
how is't ,  my noble lord ?	0
then take this man into your service ,  octavius ,  for he did the final service to my master .	0
what the goodyear ,  my lord ,  why are you thus out of measure sad ?	0
i must be gone and live, or stay and die.	0
i beg you, come in.	0
i’ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once .	0
i am poisoned .	0
people who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .	0
tybalt ,  my cousin !	0
i’d like to introduce you to my friend .	0
now, whether he kill cassio, or cassio him, or each do kill the other, every way makes my gain.	0
i have a salt and sorry rheum offends me .	0
well ,  stand aside . —'fore god ,  they are both in a ale .	0
sweet bassanio, my ships have all sunk, my creditors grow cruel, my funds very low, my promise to pay to the jew is in default; and since, in paying it, it is impossible for me to live, all debts between you and me are canceled if i might only see you at my death.	0
laugh at the power of other men ,  because nobody born from a woman will ever harm macbeth .	0
why ,  here begins his morning story right; these two antipholuses ,  these two so like ,  and these two dromios ,  one in semblance— besides her urging of her wreck at sea— these are the parents to these children ,  which accidentally are met together .	0
bring it to that ,  the gold i give thee will i melt and pour down thy ill - uttering throat .	0
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.	0
my god ,  she can’t be a jew ,  she’s too nice !	0
tis since the earthquake now eleven years; and she was wean'd (i never shall forget it) ,  of all the days of the year ,  upon that day; for i had then laid wormwood to my dug ,  sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .	0
i agree ,  and then is death a benefit .	0
yuck!	0
in this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?	0
i’ll court his favors .	0
i’m afraid that a worse man will take his place .	0
i saw mark antony offer him a crown—though it wasn’t a real crown ,  just a small circlet—and ,  as i told you ,  he refused it once—though in my opinion he would’ve liked to have it .	0
tell us where 'tis ,  that we may take it thence and bear it to the chapel .	0
whose house ?	0
this is lucentio’s house .	0
we should profane the service of the dead to sing a requiem and such rest to her as to peace - parted souls .	0
my darling othello !	0
do i ,  sir ?	0
where’s cesario going ?	0
well ,  then ,  what are you messing up ?	0
and is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?	0
with whom?	0
i wouldn’t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .	0
it is ,  it is !	0
brutus ”  and  “ caesar .  ”  what’s so special about  “ caesar ”  ?	0
but, my good lord— wherefore should you do this?	0
farewell, good launcelot.	0
avoid ,  and leave him .	0
i have years on my back forty -  eight .	0
do you see nothing there?	0
i do indeed ,  my lord .	0
they that have done this deed are honorable .	0
where do you come from?	0
i think i hear the drums far away .	0
kate ,  my wooing is fit for your understanding: i am glad your english isn’t better .	0
nor i ,  my lord ,  really .	0
how is it that you’ve come back so soon ?	0
so do i.	0
stephano !	0
away ,  i do beseech you ,  both away .	0
gallants ,  i am not as i have been .	0
hoo !	0
ay ,  sir ,  we are some of her trappings .	0
a thousand thousand !	0
your royal father's murdered.	0
now ,  in faith ,  gratiano ,  you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief; an 'twere to me ,  i should be mad at it .	0
a plague on both your houses!	0
therefore i took your hands ,  but was indeed swayed from the point by looking down on caesar .	0
it’s possible ,  ma'am .	0
what ,  are they children ?	0
you’re    pull out your tool now .	0
we have not made good preparation.	0
noble banquo ,  who has deserved no less ,  and must not be known to have done less than macbeth ,  let me infold you in my arms and stop you to my heart .	0
there were no primary ones .	0
where do i live ?	0
ay ,  marry ,  must you .	0
well, my good lord.	0
oh ,  my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .	0
i pray that god ends his life before i die ,  so i can say ,   “ the dog is dead !  ”	0
i’ll tell you at a better time .	0
sweet sir andrew !	0
if you do ,  i shall never love you after .	0
this is the woman, but not this the man.	0
shall i go get your nightgown ?	0
your sons will be kings, even though you will not be king.	0
hark, they roar!	0
if we do meet again, we'll smile indeed; if not, it’s true this parting was the right thing to do.	0
even if you didn’t have the power to pull me, i would still be powerless not to follow you.	0
tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?	0
you are to blame ,  my lord ,  to rate her so .	0
that you do love me ,  i am nothing jealous .	0
i am bound by oath ,  so please forgive me .	0
i pro- test unto thee— good heart, and i’ faith i will tell her as much.	0
will you go ,  coz ?	0
o wretched villain !	0
the devil speaks in him.	0
now sit we close about this taper here and call in question our necessities .	0
the demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion ,  could return to hell and tell the devil’s legions ,   “ i will never win another soul as easily as i won that englishman’s .  ”  how you have poisoned my faith in people !	0
the watery kingdom ,  whose ambitious head spits in the face of heaven ,  is no bar to stop the foreign spirits ,  but they come as o'er a brook to see fair portia .	0
i have no gift for the one and no strength for the other ,  though i have the gift of strength .	0
lady, by the blessed moon up there, that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops, i swear o, don’t swear by the moon, the inconstant moon, that monthly goes through changes in her circled orbit, for fear that your love prove as variable as the moon.	0
the revelers are entering ,  brother .	0
that’s enough ,  dromio ,  please .	0
young men's love ,  then ,  lies not truly in their hearts ,  but in their eyes .	0
some twenty of them fought in this black strife ,  and all those twenty could but kill one life .	0
faith ,  here's an english tailor come hither ,  for stealing out of a french hose .	0
whence come you ?	0
nay ,  that you shall not .	0
some such squire he was that turn'd your wit the seamy side without ,  and made you to suspect me with the moor .	0
o ,  the world has not a sweeter creature .	0
and it’s a wonder that he’s late ,  because lovers always keep ahead of the clock .	0
the king is a thing, a thing, my lord!	0
too cruel any where.	0
and there’s a messenger representing a fifth one ,  the prince of morocco ,  who says the prince will be here tonight .	0
but never mind.	0
that i don’t trust you.	0
heaven, and thy thoughts, are witness that thou art.	0
i would know that .	0
see ,  see ,  our honored hostess !	0
the foul practice hath turn'd itself on me .	0
you are right.	0
delay not, caesar; read it instantly.	0
not a jot more ,  my lord .	0
help !	0
those linen cheeks of thine are counselors to fear .	0
wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster?	0
you think i’m a sponge ,  my lord ?	0
that whore ?	0
this hand of yours requires a sequester from liberty ,  fasting and prayer ,  much castigation ,  exercise devout ,  for here's a young and sweating devil here that commonly rebels .	0
but this is trifling, and all the more it seeks to hide itself the bigger bulk it shows.	0
remember first to possess his books, for without them he's but a sot, as i am, nor hath not one spirit to command—they all do hate him as rootedly as i.	0
o!	0
is not that he ?	0
well ,  more in a minute .	0
all with me’s meet that i can fashion fit .	0
i must find a reader .	0
let’s shake hands all over again ,  one by one .	0
get you to your lord .	0
who calls me villain?	0
off ,  pluck off !	0
i pray you, is my master yet return'd?	0
stay ,  dog ,  for thou shalt hear me .	0
no ,  because my manly heart is grieving .	0
madam ,  the guests are come ,  supper serv'd up ,  you call'd ,  my young lady ask'd for ,  the nurse curs'd in the pantry ,  and everything in extremity .	0
but silence ,  like a knife ,  cuts open my heart with strokes that draw no blood .	0
you’re overstepping your bounds now .	0
i am the greatest ,  able to do least ,  yet most suspected ,  as the time and place cast suspicion on me as guilty of this sad murder; and here i stand ,  both to accuse and free myself ,  condemned and myself excused .	0
ay ,  ay !	0
do you want to know who they are ,  then ?	0
romeo?	0
she’s yours . —come ,  ariel !	0
i’m at your service until death .	0
what should he be ?	0
talk to the ambassadors who’ve just come back: ask them how majestically he responded to their message ,  how well supplied he was with good advisors ,  how restrained in expressing his displeasure ,  and ,  moreover ,  how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve .	0
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch?	0
friends both ,  go join you with some further aid .	0
swear.	0
is that barnardo ?	0
what will you give me now for that same handkerchief ?	0
how every event works against me to spur my dull revenge!	0
if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb ,  is it meet ,  think you ,  that we should also ,  look you ,  be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb ,  in your own conscience ,  now ?	0
here in these confines slyly have i lurked to watch the waning of mine enemies .	0
where is he ?	0
god almighty ,  there must be some essential goodness even in evil ,  if men would only look for it .	0
if he awake ,  from toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches ,  make us strange stuff .	0
this world is not for aye ,  nor 'tis not strange that even our loves should with our fortunes change; for 'tis a question left us yet to prove ,  whether love lead fortune ,  or else fortune love .	0
impart .	0
what is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?	0
no, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning.	0
pray you ,  sit still .	0
where are my father and my mother ,  nurse ?	0
what cursed foot wanders this way to-night to cross my obsequies and true love's rite?	0
we'll wait upon you .	0
ask for me tomorrow ,  and you shall find me a grave man .	0
pardon me but i do not know what is  “ like me .  ”  an angel is like you ,  kate ,  and you are like an angel .	0
therefore pardon me, and not impute this yielding to light love, which the dark night hath so discovered.	0
to withdraw with you— why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?	0
it takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .	0
where are you ?	0
to hell with your sword .	0
an old italian fox is not so kind ,  my boy .	0
i passed ,  methought ,  the melancholy flood ,  with that sour ferryman which poets write of ,  unto the kingdom of perpetual night .	0
when ?	0
at least two glasses.	0
thy dæmon—that thy spirit which keeps thee—is noble ,  courageous ,  high ,  unmatchable where caesar’s is not .	0
the battle on the sea is almost lost .	0
ah sir ,  ah sir .	0
i am paid for ’t now .	0
will you go with me ?	0
good words are better than bad strokes, octavius.	0
driven ?  ”  really ?	0
to tell thee thou shalt see me at philippi.	0
oh god ,  did romeo’s hand shed tybalt’s blood ?	0
nonsense ,  nonsense ,  it will not appear .	0
is ’t frailty that thus errs ?	0
seyton ,  send out .	0
come, let’s go to the castle.	0
good hamlet ,  take off your black looks ,  and let your eye look on the king like a friend .	0
i will have it all mine .	0
a worthy pioner!	0
do you hear ,  roderigo ?	0
i wot well where he is .	0
i will have nothing else but only this .	0
he’s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .	0
see the wound that casca made .	0
and but my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such baseness as jealous creatures are ,  it were enough to put him to ill thinking .	0
i am too bold ,  she’s not speaking to me .	0
i’m helping  indeed ,  sir ,  find something better to do and get lost for a while .	0
i hid me under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of the storm.	0
let the doors be shut upon him ,  that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house .	0
calls my lord?	0
but let that go.	0
so you think you won’t marry again ,  but you’ll change your mind when your first lord is dead .	0
how foolish your fears seem now ,  calpurnia !	0
oh ,  you streetwalker !	0
this world is almost six thousand years old ,  and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love .	0
blind is his love and best befits the dark.	0
a good deed in a naughty world shines like that .	0
o shame !	0
but i’ll punish them thoroughly .	0
he is in earnest .	0
this hand is moist, my lady.	0
tis time i should inform thee farther .	0
methinks i hear antony call .	0
i’ll go find him.	0
shame on you—get on board !	0
brutus, my lord!	0
but ,  brother ,  i can tell you strange news that you yet dreamt not of .	0
what is the matter here ?	0
good morning to you both .	0
tis true ,  my lords ,  he did .	0
for now, this fearful night, there is no stir or walking in the streets, and the complexion of the element in favor's like the work we have in hand, most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.	0
i will do this deed before i lose my sense of purpose .	0
my beautiful warrior !	0
when our actions do not make us traitors ,  our fears do .	0
i am very sorry that you are not well.	0
i'll have some proof.	0
then it is most likely that the crown will fall upon macbeth .	0
even if she lives till the end of the world ,  she’d keep burning an additional week .	0
will you go see the order of the winners of the race ?	0
is romeo slaught'red ,  and is tybalt dead ?	0
go with me ,  and in the breath of bitter words let’s smother my damnèd son that thy two sweet sons smothered .	0
then have at thee ,  boy !	0
to have a foolish wife .	0
antonio shall be obligated; right ?	0
prithee ,  nuncle ,  be contented .	0
let him look to his bond .	0
i have of late, but why i don’t know, lost all my joy, given up all habits of exercises, and indeed, i am so depressed that this good frame, the earth, seems to me to be a sterile outpost, this most excellent canopy, the air— look—, this brave sky hanging over us, this majestic roof divided with golden fire, why, it seems to me to be nothing but a dirty and disgusting meeting of vapors.	0
this tyrant, whose only name blisters our tongues, was once thought honest.	0
fortune is an excellent moral .	0
to all, and to him we miss, and all to all.	0
for hecuba !	0
i have more news too .	0
away ,  get going !	0
it hath not appeared.	0
should i get your nightgown ?	0
i am much bound to you.	0
what ,  must i hold a candle to my shames ?	0
romeo ,  hist !	0
one hundred sixty-eight hours?	0
indeed ,  my lord ,  it followed very soon after .	0
i am too sore from being pierced with cupid’s shaft to soar with his wings; and so wounded, i cannot jump even a little bit above dull woe.	0
if love be rough with you ,  be rough with love .	0
shall we get started ?	0
we’ll outwit them all—that old geezer ,  gremio; the suspicious father ,  minola; the prim musician lover ,  litio—all for the sake of my master ,  lucentio .	0
here’s the hut ,  my lord .	0
but he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who’s supposed to be his enemy .	0
thou marshall'st me the way that i was going, and such an instrument i was to use.	0
coming from sardis, two mighty eagles fell on our former ensign, and they perched there, gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands; who were associated with us here in philippi.	0
of course he is ,  and so are you .	0
shall we call in th' ambassador ,  my liege ?	0
ready .	0
it was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, which gives the stern'st good-night.	0
so all hail ,  macbeth and banquo !	0
thanks ,  dear my lord .	0
what shall i know of thee ?	0
i am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor .	0
delay this marriage for a month ,  a week; or ,  if you don’t ,  make my bridal bed in that dim tomb where tybalt lies .	0
romeo, leave, be gone!	0
but this rough magic i here abjure ,  and when i have required some heavenly music ,  which even now i do ,  to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for ,  i’ll break my staff ,  bury it certain fathoms in the earth ,  and deeper than did ever plummet sound i’ll drown my book .	0
please ,  tell my father ,  madam ,  i won’t marry yet .	0
he’ll say ’twas done cowardly ,  when he wakes .	0
is cassius nearby ?	0
but ,  unfortunately ,  caesar has to bleed if we’re going to stop him .	0
good hay ,  sweet hay ,  hath no fellow .	0
if you’re my friend ,  you’ll let me see his letter .	0
lead me from hence .	0
it is too late .	0
you too ,  brutus ? — then fall ,  caesar !	0
shall't be tonight at supper?	0
they were traitors .	0
ah ,  sirrah ,  by my fay ,  it waxes late; i'll to my rest .	0
he’ll tell you more of the story .	0
ha !	0
are you really going to pretend you don’t know me now ?	0
i was deceived all the more.	0
they hold up adam's profession.	0
this grisly beast, which known by name lion, scared away or rather frightened the trusty thisbe, coming first to the place by night; and as she fled, she dropped her shawl, which vile lion stained with his bloody mouth.	0
o god of battles ,  steel my soldiers' hearts .	0
stand there !	0
i ,  thus neglecting worldly ends ,  all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which ,  but by being so retired ,  o'er prized all popular rate ,  in my false brother awakened an evil nature; and my trust ,  like a good parent ,  did beget of him a falsehood ,  in its contrary as great as my trust was ,  which had indeed no limit ,  a confidence sans bound .	0
how are you, balthasar?	0
it is engender'd .	0
the whole world is a stage ,  and all the men and women merely actors .	0
we shall, my lord.	0
a piece of him.	0
the clock has chimed midnight .	0
that would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .	0
let’s to bed ,  knight .	0
you were kneeled to an importuned otherwise by all of us, and the fair soul herself weighed between loathness and obedience at which end o'th’ beam should bow.	0
o time ,  thou must untangle this ,  not i .	0
or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts ?	0
do but go after and mark how he continues .	0
and yet she’ll kneel and pray ,  i have seen her do ’t .	0
could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, and batten on this moor?	0
it’s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .	0
get thee to bed ,  and rest; for thou hast need .	0
i wish the night were here now!	0
what are you fighting about ?	0
it’s hard to make sense of such different stories .	0
it was a rough night .	0
caesar brought many captives home to rome ,  whose ransoms filled the national treasury .	0
the games are finished ,  and caesar is returning .	0
nothing but  “ low ”  and  “ little ”  ! — why will you suffer her to flout me thus ?	0
let me come clean .	0
what’s your answer ?	0
where is he ?	0
most mighty caesar ,  give me some reason ,  so i won’t be laughed at when i tell them so .	0
call me the worst liar ?	0
i’m sure you know him .	0
oh ,  she was heavenly true !	0
if we should fail ?	0
i confess it is my shame to be so fond ,  but it is not in my virtue to amend it .	0
bad news ,  my lord .	0
very heathenish and very gross !	0
he can’t possibly be such a monster— and i’m sure he isn’t .	0
the ground is bloody .	0
but i confess ,  sir ,  that we were locked out .	0
take heed ,  take heed ,  for such die miserable .	0
draw your sword: one stroke shall free you from the taxes which you pay, and i the king shall be devoted to you.	0
such bugs and goblins in my life, that on the supervise, no leisure bated, no, not to stay the grinding of the axe, my head should be struck off.	0
yes ,  i will .	0
brown ,  madam ,  and her forehead as low as she would wish it .	0
why ,  how are you ,  juliet ?	0
i will have none on't.	0
i’ll tell the news .	0
let me but bind it hard ,  within this hour it will be well .	0
you have said now .	0
but ,  come ,  for england !	0
their ships are yare ,  yours ,  heavy .	0
that he was never trained as a soldier .	0
she stood and spoke .	0
when truth kills truth, oh devilish-holy fight!	0
the fit is momentary; in a minute ,  he will again be well .	0
that’s true ,  and with good reason .	0
why ,  i am sure ,  if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh .	0
but my uncle - father and aunt - mother are deceived .	0
lover !	0
how are you ,  charmian ?	0
ladies whose toes are not plagued with corns will have a dance with you.	0
i know him; he wears a lock .	0
ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name when i, thy three-hours’ wife, have mangled it?	0
and squabble ?	0
so were their daggers ,  which unwiped we found upon their pillows .	0
for love of god ,  forbear him !	0
what dost thou know me for ?	0
what, of venice?	0
oh ,  wonder !	0
if we meet him at philippi ,  these people will be at our backs .	0
marry ,  sir ,  to get a husband for her sister .	0
i am not to you known, though, in your state of honor i am perfect.	0
and i for no woman .	0
you’ll see that you’re both wrong.	0
i pray you tell your brother how well i counterfeited .	0
and strength shall help afford .	0
are you drunk ?	0
not in deed ,  madam ,  for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done .	0
let me still take away the harms i fear ,  not fear still to be taken .	0
come on!.	0
if caesar chose ,  antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .	0
are there balance here to weigh the flesh?	0
all these are portable ,  with other graces weigh'd .	0
who chooses me shall get as much as he deserves.” as much as he deserves!	0
demetrius, i'll swear it on his head, pursued nedar's daughter, helena, the same way, and won her soul; and she, sweet lady, loves, devoutly loves, loves to the point of divine worship, this spotted and inconstant man.	0
why ,  what’s the matter with him ?	0
so hangs and lolls and weeps upon me; so hales and pulls me.	0
it is but trash .	0
i swear ,  i don’t like the look of you .	0
you have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .	0
no further ,  sir .	0
no more yet about this; because it is a story of day by day ,  not a story for a breakfast or befitting this first meeting .	0
then a third of the world is drunk .	0
this is the voice of friar john .	0
tonight she is shut up in her room ,  alone with her sadness .	0
what wilt thou do ?	0
the hand of death has taken him .	0
did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garments he had on ?	0
as he shall smile ,  othello shall go mad .	0
in faith ,  he’s penitent ,  and yet his trespass ,  in our common reason (save that ,  they say ,  the wars must make example out of her best) is not ,  almost ,  a fault t' incur a private check .	0
well ,  may peace be with you .	0
you’ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me ,  but i’m as sane as you are .	0
you sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .	0
what ,  thou speak’st drowsily ?	0
say anything .	0
peace, ho!	0
give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .	0
it is brabantio . —general ,  be advised; he comes to bad intent .	0
kent’s been banished just like that ?	0
isn’t it monstrous that this actor here ,  only in a play ,  in a dream of passion ,  could force his soul so to his own actions that his grew pale from the words of the speech ,  tears in his eyes ,  separation from reality in his face ,  a broken voice ,  and his whole function matching forms to his role ?	0
revive ,  look up ,  or i will die with thee !	0
here comes your father.	0
bless thee from whirlwinds ,  star - blasting ,  and taking !	0
what did thy song bode ,  lady ?	0
ay ,  do you fear it ?	0
i’m afraid you’ll keep going until then .	0
i think this applause is for some new honors awarded to caesar .	0
what said he when he came to?	0
i have no food for thee .	0
why do you come ?	0
what news ?	0
oh ,  fie upon thee ,  slanderer !	0
i can’t blame you ,  old lord .	0
how does my good lord hamlet ?	0
he has a person ,  and a smooth disposition ,  to be suspected ,  framed to make women lie .	0
i say ,  remember .	0
is your master awake yet?	0
so ,  good night unto you all .	0
o ,  how i love thee !	0
so stop crying .	0
his present and your pains we thank you for .	0
she ,  dying ,  gave it me and bid me ,  when my fate would have me wived ,  to give it her .	0
thank god ,  thank god !	0
now to you .	0
nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an eyrie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question and are most tyrannically clapped for't.	0
well then, your bond; and, let me see.	0
i’m warning you .	0
she speaks ,  yet she says nothing .	0
effect it with some care, that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love.	0
test me, and i will re-word the problem, which madness would run away from.	0
be patient with me ,  good boy ,  i’m very forgetful .	0
what is the matter?	0
what sights ,  my lord ?	0
how fares my juliet ?	0
or art thou but a dagger of the mind, a false creation, proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?	0
yes, or hide the report in the pocket.	0
but quiet ,  be quiet a minute .	0
and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her ,  from whom i took two cods and ,  giving her them again ,  said with weeping tears ,   “ wear these for my sake .  ”  we that are true lovers run into strange capers .	0
what ?	0
the one i’ll stay ,  the other stayeth me .	0
i know a thousand immature tricks like that ,  and i’ll use them all .	0
how is it, my lord?	0
most royal sir ,  fleance is 'scaped .	0
hear you ought of her in yours?	0
did heaven look on and would not take their side ?	0
what if it come to thee again ?	0
ah sir!	0
when i am known aright you shall not grieve lending me this acquaintance .	0
we are undone ,  lady ,  we are undone !	0
true ,  madam; he ,  that ,  of all the men that i have ever seen with my foolish eyes ,  was the most deserving of a beautiful lady .	0
for my part, i have walked about the streets, giving in to the dangerous night; and, undressed like this, casca, as you can see, i have bared my chest to the thunder bolts; and when the angry, blue lightning seemed to openthe chest of heaven, i put myself even in the direction and the very flash of it.	0
what was the last cry for?	0
i tell you 'tis not very well .	0
you must contrary me !	0
i’ll do it.	0
farewell ,  hostess .	0
by such despair i should accuse myself .	0
you know ,  uncle ,  a sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow’s head off .	0
as thou art to thyself.	0
worse and worse !	0
an angel is like you ,  kate ,  and you are like an angel .	0
she has abandoned so many noble matches, her father, and her country, and her friends, to be called whore?	0
hear me a word ,  for i shall never speak to thee again .	0
how did he become crazy?	0
you’ve made up your mind ,  then ?	0
most beautiful pagan, most sweet jew!	0
and this report hath so exasperated the king that he prepares for some attempt of war .	0
indeed ,  sir ,  it is .	0
thou dost mean something .	0
come break this up ,  benvolio .	0
by heaven, i do not, i do not, gentlemen.	0
it is the quality o' th' climate .	0
i have stayed for thee ,  god knows ,  in torment and in agony .	0
concerning this, sir—o well-painted passion!— i am commanded home.	0
ah ,  i’ve got it !	0
caesar, beware of brutus; be careful of cassius; don’t come near casca; watch cinna; don’t trust trebonius; pay attention to metellus cimber; decius brutus doesn’t love you; you’ve sinned against caius ligarius.	0
all right ,  friar francis ,  let’s keep this short .	0
i wish you had deserved less, then the greater proportion both of thanks and payment might have been my!	0
you said the enemy wouldn’t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .	0
o, you’re pale!	0
hie you to horse .	0
by this sword ,  i’ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .	0
i'll make so bold to call ,  because it is my limited service .	0
what should we say ,  my lord ?	0
emilia ,  run you to the citadel and tell my lord and lady what hath happed . — will you go on afore ?	0
towards him i made ,  but he was 'ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood .	0
welcome, dear rosencrantz and guildenstern.	0
when the hurlyburly's done; when the battle's lost and won .	0
let me hear from you .	0
how fares my juliet?	0
my god ,  it’s nauseating !	0
think upon what hath chanced ,  and at more time ,  the interim having weigh'd it ,  let us speak our free hearts each to other .	0
or did i dream it so?	0
you see how full of changes his age is .	0
this is his second fit .	0
what have you heard from her ?	0
withdraw ,  my lord .	0
i’m not asking you to call her .	0
but come what sorrow can ,  it cannot countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight .	0
then edgar was abused .	0
all’s well .	0
at first and last the hearty welcome .	0
your loyalty, as mine to you.	0
here's decius brutus ,  he shall tell them so .	0
i thank your lordship .	0
rather your eyes must with his judgment look.	0
what could my sister’s letter to him say ?	0
pindarus shall run far from this country ,  where no roman shall ever notice him .	0
welcome to rome .	0
you’re whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .	0
why, there, there, there, there!	0
what do you want with her ,  sir ?	0
o hard condition ,  twin - born with greatness ,  subject to the breath of every fool ,  whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing .	0
aren’t you kent ?	0
i don’t know what its intentions are, but, in the plainness and freedom of my opinion, this foretells some strange eruption to our state.	0
whiles i threat ,  he lives; words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives .	0
what men have you lost ,  fluellen ?	0
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry a cannon by our sides.	0
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .	0
yes ,  but he’d deny it all .	0
i do beseech you ,  give him leave to go .	0
but ,  however you pursue this revenge ,  don’t taint your mind ,  or let your soul plan anything against your mother .	0
prithee ,  listen well .	0
welcome ,  dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .	0
i have a pain upon my forehead ,  here .	0
i pray you tell me .	0
good my lord ,  vouchsafe me a word with you .	0
a sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap ,  and munched ,  and munched ,  and munched .	0
now you know ,  casca ,  i have already persuaded some certain of the noblest - minded romans to join me in an undertaking of honorable/dangerous consequence; and i know by this ,  they are waiting for me in pompey's porch .	0
what should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?	0
truly ,  madam ,  i don’t hear anything .	0
i prithee ,  shepherd ,  if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment ,  bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed .	0
then be your eyes the witness of their evil .	0
what worser place can i beg in your love , — and yet a place of high respect with me , — than to be used as you use your dog ?	0
but please ,  can you read anything you see ?	0
o ,  villain that i am !	0
yes ,  with a heart as willing as slavery was ever willing of freedom: here's my hand .	0
by this hand, i say 'tis very scurvy, and begin to find myself fopped in it.	0
she’s accustomed to it ,  to seem to washing her hands in this way .	0
it’s as easy as lying .	0
saw you anything ?	0
flute, you must take thisbe on you.	0
we have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .	0
what is between you ?	0
god - a - mercy ,  grumio !	0
good fortune ,  worthy soldier ,  and farewell .	0
o hell !	0
go ,  villain ,  get a doctor .	0
then meet me forthwith at the notary's; give him direction for this merry bond, and i will go and purse the ducats straight; see to my house, left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave; and presently i will be with you.	0
our country weeps ,  it bleeds ,  and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .	0
i’ll do it.	0
the king - becoming graces ,  as justice ,  verity ,  temperance ,  stableness ,  bounty ,  perseverance ,  mercy ,  lowliness ,  devotion ,  patience ,  courage ,  fortitude ,  i have no relish of them ,  but abound in the division of each several crime ,  acting it many ways .	0
ah, mine own lord, what have i seen tonight!	0
heaven thumbs its nose at it, and the moon winks; the obscene wind that kisses all it meets is quiet within the hollow tunnels of earth, and will not hear it.	0
ay ,  there it is .	0
if she is silent and won’t speak at all ,  i’ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence .	0
oh ,  the glory of war has faded .	0
thunder] [thunder] alas ,  the storm is come again !	0
in the country, i would carry out all things by opposites; because i wouldn’t admit any kind of traffic; have no one named magistrate; appeals before a court wouldn’t be recognized; riches, poverty, and slavery, none; treaties, lines of succession, boundaries, boundary lines of land, farming, vineyards, none; no use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; no occupations; all men idle, all: and women too, only innocent and pure; no supreme ruler,— but he would be king on it.	0

that which we call a rose would smell as sweet if it had any other name.	0
will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?	0
you shall be king .	0
we’ll take care of it .	0
i mean, sir, in delay we waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.	0
my lord ,  fair helen told me of their stealth ,  of this their purpose hither to this wood; and i in fury hither followed them ,  fair helena in fancy following me .	0

no ,  monster ,  not me .	0
can virtue hide itself ?	0
sir, she is mortal; but by immortal providence she's mine.	0
why, is not this better now than groaning for love?	0
nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .	0
in this wicked world ,  criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law ,  shoving justice aside .	0
go to him from me .	0
wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if i depend on the issue?	0
where is polonius?	0
the wife of antony should have an army for an usher and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear .	0
have you got eyes ?	0
let this act be the stone that sharpens your sword .	0
oh ,  correct it completely .	0
ay ,  and he’ll tame her .	0
welcome, wanderer.	0
they’ve switched their operation to the sea today .	0
let me go .	0
please give it to me.	0

brutus shall lead ,  and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome .	0
tell her to put her mind at rest .	0
and subjects of the dane.	0
it is much ,  that the moor should be more than reason: but if she be less than an honest woman ,  she is ,  indeed more than i took her for .	0
whom should i knock ?	0
i’ll expect you .	0
yes ,  it’s emilia .	0
this physic but prolongs thy sickly days .	0
don’t be so quick to twist my meaning .	0
this is no place for you; this home is now a slaughterhouse .	0
i pledged my love to you before you asked me to .	0
poor birds do not fall down.	0
wilt thou be gone ?	0
please ,  let's have no more fooling about it ,  but give me your blessing; i am launcelot ,  your boy that was ,  your son that is ,  your child that shall be .	0
o ,  these outbursts and jerky shaking ,  impostors of true fear ,  would well become a woman's story at a winter's fire ,  confirmed by her grandmother .	0
i’ll not be strucken ,  my lord .	0
oh painful sympathy !	0
i am sorry to hear this.	0
why should he call her whore?	0
with this i depart—that ,  as i slew my best lover for the good of rome ,  i have the same dagger for myself ,  when it shall please my country to need my death .	0
fair leda’s daughter had a thousand wooers; then well one more may fair bianca have .	0

their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine ,  but when he touches them ,  they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven .	0
but i pray, can you read any thing you see?	0
run to the capitol ,  and nothing else ?	0
so come with me .	0
the capon burns; the pig falls from the spit; the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; my mistress made it one upon my cheek .	0
ready.	0
she’s not good enough for you ,  then .	0
maybe she can’t meet him.	0
do you hear me ?	0
what do you say then ,  would heart of man once think it ?	0
well ,  you do what’s best .	0
indeed ,  on my sword ,  indeed .	0
it’s better to be with the dead, whom we have sent to their peace to gain our peace, than to lie on a bed, torturing of the mind in a restless frenzy.	0
why then ,  my cousin ,  margaret ,  and ursula are much deceived ,  for they did swear you did .	0
shame come to romeo !	0
proceed with your tears.	0
but it was—as i received it ,  and others ,  whose judgments in such matters cried in the top of mine—an excellent play ,  well digested in the scenes ,  set down with as much modesty as cunning .	0
there's no offense ,  my lord .	0
what's the matter?	0
now i only scold ,  but i should give you worse; because you ,  i fear ,  has given me cause to curse .	0
he never gave orders for their deaths .	0
i'll not believe it.	0
will you go see the order of the course ?	0
sirrah, give place.	0

okay ,  so that’s when he’ll say we stabbed him in his sleep .	0
their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage .	0
the little song reminds me of my drowned father.	0
will you laugh me asleep, because i am exhausted?	0

greed has been the downfall of many kings .	0
the son of duncan, from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth, lives in the english court and is received of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect.	0
they pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn’t find its heart .	0
god mark you for his grace!	0
o iago!	0
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in .	0
you won’t get any bad cooks from me .	0
shall rome stand under one man's awe ?	0
my lord ,  i would that thursday were tomorrow .	0
tis time to look about .	0
an i were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.	0
tarry ,  rash wanton .	0
o ,  well done !	0
now ,  music ,  sound ,  and sing your solemn hymn .	0
remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were ,  and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is .	0
iago ?	0
i don’t know either .	0
just listen this once .	0
i can live no longer by thinking .	0
why, revenge.	0
do not doubt ,  cassio ,  but i will have my lord and you again as friendly as you were .	0
ah ,  ladies ,  ladies !	0
i don’t know whether he combined forces with those of norway ,  or aided the rebel with hidden help and supplies ,  or that with both he labored to overthrow his country's government ,  only his treasons ,  punishable by death ,  confessed and proven ,  have caused his downfall .	0
consider yourself more dearly, or, not to keep harping on that poor phrase, doing harm to it, you'll “offer” me a fool!	0
say thou but  “ ay ,  ”  and that bare vowel  than the death - darting eye of cockatrice .	0
thank you ,  my noble lord .	0
the wood of birnam.	0
this is our station .	0
order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .	0
i will ,  sir .	0
i could teach you how to choose right ,  but then i’m breaking my oath; i’ll never do that; you may not win me; and if you don’t ,  you'll make me wish i had sinned ,  that i had broken my oath .	0
both your majesties might, by the sovereign power you have of us, put your huge request more into a command than to an entreaty.	0
not that we love words better, as you do.	0
i must be one of these same dumb wise men, for gratiano never lets me speak.	0
and he told us to follow him to the temple .	0
no ,  by this heavenly light !	0
here the count lies slain, and juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead, who has been buried in this tomb for two days.	0
believe me ,  i would rather have lost my purse full of money ,  and ,  except that my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such lowness as jealous creatures are ,  it would be enough to put him to ill thinking .	0
she’ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up—even if it’s a lion ,  a bear ,  a wolf ,  a bull ,  a monkey ,  or an ape .	0
you may ,  sir .	0
my father capulet wants it that way; and i won’t do anything to stop him from being so hasty.	0
but since, so jump upon this bloody question, you from the polack wars, and you from england, are here arrived, give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view; and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about.	0
well ,  if fortune be a woman ,  she's a good wench for this gear . —father ,  come .	0
i am glad of it.	0
tis thus: who tells me true ,  though in his tale lie death ,  i hear him as he flattered .	0
i’ll give you a greater gift than that ,  nephew .	0
ok, let’s sit down, and listen to bernardo speak of this.	0
i'll to the friar to know his remedy .	0
how does my old acquaintance of this isle ? — honey ,  you shall be well desired in cyprus ,  i have found great love amongst them .	0
enough .	0

good night ,  dear captain blunt .	0
i need better evidence than the ghost to work with .	0
oh ,  good judge !	0
are you up ?	0
to whom ?	0
i beg you to let me go .	0
what are you going to do for a father ?	0
i think i can find him ,  if you’d please get a good guard ,  and go along with me .	0
i have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes .	0
whoever is born on a day i forget to send a message to antony will die a beggar .	0
fie upon't!	0
but antonio is certainly undone .	0
judges?	0
my head is pounding .	0
right away.	0
your cause of sorrow must not be measured by his worth ,  because then it will have no end .	0
well ,  then ,  that’s the humor of ’t .	0
a noble prisoner !	0
is that my prize ?	0
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me .	0
i am informed thoroughly of the cause.	0
i knew there would be a masquerade when i got that bad omen of a bloody nose last easter monday ,  at six in the morning ,  four years after i got the same kind of bloody nose on ash wednesday ,  in the afternoon .	0
and what of all this ?	0
sola ,  sola !	0
come ,  friends .	0
how do you mean ?	0
do you want to go in and join the party ?	0
we should hold day with the antipodes ,  if you would walk in absence of the sun .	0
peace there !	0
let him come when he will ,  i will deny thee nothing .	0
thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt .	0
mine ,  sir .	0
ay ,  but the mustard is too hot a little .	0
in the street i met him ,  and in his company that gentleman .	0
what will you do with it, that you have been so eager for me to steal it?	0
don’t say anything .	0
please, listen well.	0
you’re a fool .	0
the courtier's ,  scholar's ,  soldier's ,  eye ,  voice ,  sword ,  the hope and flower of denmark ,  the mirror of fashion and the mold of perfect form ,  the observed of all observers ,  quite ,  quite taken down !	0
tonight we host a solemn supper ,  sir ,  and i'll request your presence .	0
go ahead; go; provide your money.	0
a sailor’s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .	0
but now ,  baptista ,  to your younger daughter .	0
o ,  horrible !	0
what news?	0
his position is hopeless .	0
just now ,  my lord .	0
well ,  oswald ?	0
you’re still here, laertes!	0
but did you ever tell him she was false ?	0
good now ,  hold thy tongue .	0
the lord grandpré .	0
never believe it .	0
i heard nothing .	0
but how did you want it made ?	0
myself will straight aboard ,  and to the state this heavy act with heavy heart relate .	0
descend .	0
come, brands, ho, fire-.	0
when shall he come ?	0
but look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.	0
i have no hope that he's undrowned .	0
i’m hanging on every word .	0
not th’ imperious show of the full - fortuned caesar ever shall be brooched with me .	0
exactly .	0
that is the very defect of the matter, sir.	0
be patient .	0
o ,  ay ,  as summer flies are in the shambles ,  that quicken even with blowing .	0
caesar’s better qualities exist in brutus ,  and we will crown him .	0
things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily that we have had no time to move our daughter.	0
by jesus ,  i think they will blow up everything if we don’t improve our tactics .	0
now it’s time to get your costumes together .	0
waking] why ,  how now ?	0
i know this is a joyful trouble to you ,  it is still only one .	0
the dropsy drown this fool!	0
then i shall bleed to death.	0
away !	0
we can’t be in two places at once ,  both here and there !	0
my will alone ,  nothing else in the world .	0
who cares for them ?	0
i will be satisfied!	0
it was carried to colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors ,  where their bones are kept safe .	0
no sovereignty—     yet he would be king on ’t .	0
i’m dying for food ,  so let me have some .	0
is my lord angry?	0
almost nine o’clock, lady.	0
tomorrow ,  as he purposes .	0
he loves me well, and i have given him reasons; send him but hither, and i'll fashion him.	0
that must we also .	0
i never caused her any harm ,  as far as i know .	0
follow my voice; we'll try no manhood here .	0
goodbye .	0
come ,  away !	0
is he married ?	0
say ,  if you would rather hear it from our mouths ,  or from our masters’ ?	0
i stretch it out for that word “broad,” which added to the goose, proves you far and wide a broad goose.	0
with this strange virtue he hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, and sundry blessings hang about his throne that speak him full of grace.	0
did you know him ?	0
peace ,  ho !	0
so shall i hope your virtues will bring him to his wonted way again, to both your honours.	0
alas ,  you know not; i must tell you then .	0
he longs not for the dawning as we do .	0
please say no more .	0
i thought the king preferred the duke of albany to the duke of cornwall .	0
wheresoever you had it, i'll take out no work on't.	0
i love you the better; the hearers may cry  “ amen .  ”  god match me with a good dancer !	0
ask her forgiveness ?	0
who are you ?	0
she gave it him ,  and he has given it his whore .	0
yes ,  noise ?	0
being surrounded like this with evil plans, before i could start thinking about it, before they could execute the plan, i sat myself down, though up a new order, wrote it just like the original.	0
o idiot !	0
o heavy hour !	0
come to me ,  that of this i may speak more .	0
brutus "  and  " caesar .  ”  what is in that name ,   " caesar ?	0
oh ,  are you come ,  iago ?	0
but hear thee ,  gratiano .	0
she only appears honorable from the outside .	0
full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time	0
well ,  what’s your plan ?	0
to think, my lord, if you do not delight in man, what a somber reception the players shall receive from you.	0
to visit you ,  my lord; no other occasion .	0
are you our daughter ?	0
i am glad to see your honor .	0
i will ,  my lord .	0
what’s done is done .	0
they want to whip me for telling the truth ,  you want to whip me for lying ,  and sometimes i’m even whipped for keeping quiet .	0
who’s born that day when i forget to send to antony shall die a beggar .	0
peace ,  and be still !	0
hark ,  hark !	0
instead of celia ,  call me aliena .	0
how is your majesty doing ?	0
he has confessed .	0
titinius is lying face - up .	0
this was kindness ?	0
where are you?	0
come ,  prepare .	0
next month he’ll stay with us .	0
ophelia ,  walk you here .	0
this i made good to you in our last conference ,  passed in probation with you ,  how you were borne in hand ,  how crossed ,  the instruments ,  who wrought with them ,  and all things else that might to half a soul and to a notion crazed say ,   “ thus did banquo .  ”       you made it known to us .	0
yea ,  my lord .	0
i am sent before to make a fire ,  and they are coming after to warm them .	0
help !	0
dying ,  sleeping—that’s all dying is—a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us—that’s an achievement to wish for .	0
mark his condition and th’event; then tell me if this might be a brother.	0
come thee on .	0
well are you welcome to the open air .	0
well praised !	0
farewell.	0
with drink, sir?	0
he named sebastian .	0
where is our usual manager of mirth?	0
why not ,  my lord ?	0
tis he.	0
i am about it; but indeed my invention comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze; it plucks out brains and all.	0
no ,  none at all .	0
either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead ,  or earth gape open wide and eat him quick ,  as thou dost swallow up this good king’s blood ,  which his hell - governed arm hath butcherèd !	0
didn’t they pass by you ?	0
we are arrant knaves all; believe none of us.	0
yes ,  my lord .	0
she speaks much of her father; says she hears there's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart; spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, that carry but half sense.	0
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice, and could of men distinguish her election, sh'hath seal'd thee for herself.	0
none but the fool ,  who labors to outjest his heart - struck injuries .	0
now to my word: it is goodbye ,  goodbye !	0
you’re not my friend .	0
i’ll prove that i’m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself .	0
do you think they’re married?	0
and wake diana with a hymn; with sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear, and draw her home with music.	0
why should that name be sounded more than yours?	0
not so ,  neither .	0
put money in thy purse .	0
what ,  from myself ?	0
now i realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man ,  but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself .	0
sir, i’ll give you a whole history.	0
a challenge ,  on my life .	0
it is ,  my lord .	0
at nine.	0
what devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?	0
which i made of the bark of a tree, with my own hands, since i was cast ashore.	0
the king has agreed to every point: first his daughter ,  then everything else ,  as you strictly proposed .	0
get me some poison ,  iago ,  this night .	0
you have .	0
love give me strength ,  and strength shall help afford .	0
if there isn’t a solution ,  i have the power to kill myself .	0
with duty and desire we follow you .	0
but as ’tis ,  we cannot miss him .	0
thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts ,  having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .	0
my friends ,  are you all lady olivia’s servants ?	0
but goodbye .	0
be as your fancies teach you; whate'er you be, i am obedient.	0
i said so when first i raised the storm.	0
fore heaven ,  they have given me a rouse already .	0
will it not be ?	0
the whole time .	0
cicero too ?	0
if that’s not enough ,  i’ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much ,  and i’ll give you my hands ,  my head ,  and my heart as security .	0
and you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods ,  goodbye !	0
your words suit you as your wounds do; they both tell of honor .	0
anyway ,  how are you ,  jessica ?	0
cure her of that.	0
how that might change his nature ,  there’s the question .	0
we must die ,  messala .	0
who offered him the crown ?	0
give thy thoughts no tongue, nor any unproportion'd thought his act.	0
and no one eat any onions or garlic .	0
oh ,  i wish we could unmask scoundrels like that ,  and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with !	0
my wits faints .	0
how is hamlet ?	0
first ,  pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself ,  which the ladies cannot stand .	0
i’m going ahead to get my spot to see him pass on his way to the capitol.	0
we are enough yet living in the field to smother up the english in our throngs ,  if any order might be thought upon .	0
here’s another ,  more potent than the first .	0
follow my mother.	0
my name is mary ,  sir .	0
that’s true ,  my lord: i did get this ring from her .	0
most rightful judge!	0
she can’t stand to hear about getting a husband .	0
no ,  no ,  i’m as ugly as a bear ,  since animals that see me run away in terror .	0
hark !	0
not that adam that kept the paradise ,  but that adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the calf’s skin that was killed for the prodigal; he that came behind you ,  sir ,  like an evil angel ,  and bid you forsake your liberty .	0
what follows ,  then ,  my lord ?	0
widow ?	0
do we have devils here?	0
and here he stands .	0
proclaim no shame when the compulsive passion takes charge ,  since frost itself burns as well ,  and reason pimps the will .	0
but you’re still my child ,  my flesh and blood—or rather you’re a disease in my flesh ,  a disease i still have to call my own .	0
no, don’t go back.	0
i'll run from you, and hide in the bushes, and leave you to the mercy of wild beasts.	0
that octavius ,  antony ,  and lepidus have put to death an hundred senators by decrees of death and bills in defiance of the law .	0
but wait ,  there’s some prose after her poem .	0
antonio is a good man .	0
i say amen to her .	0
madam ,  do you .	0
i dare not ,  dear ,  dear my lord ,  pardon ,  i dare not ,  lest i be taken .	0
and that’s how my brother robbed me of my life ,  my crown ,  and my queen all at once .	0
ay .	0
o day and night ,  but this is wondrous strange !	0
caesar wrote for him to come to rome .	0
open your gates .	0
fate ,  do your work .	0
he is fortifying his castle at dunsinane with heavy defenses .	0
she’s a most triumphant lady ,  if report be square to her .	0
there was more foolery yet, if could remember it.	0
have you both really given me up ?	0
this is the very coinage of your brain .	0
i remember a mass of things ,  but nothing distinctly .	0
no, in truth, sir, he should not.	0
to know my deed ,  it’s best not know myself .	0
oh ,  lady ,  speak again .	0
who comes so quickly in silence of the night ?	0
what, ho!	0
i’ll call thee  “ hamlet ,  ”   “ king ,  ”   “ father ,  ”   “ royal dane .  ”  o ,  answer me !	0
is he alone ?	0
how is it else the man i' the moon?	0
rosencrantz and guildenstern hold their course for england.	0
friends to this ground .	0
no ,  his mouth is stopped .	0
he that you knows you ,  hamlet .	0
had he his hurts before?	0
where have you been ,  sister ?	0
forgive my boldness if i take you up on your words about making magic .	0
i cannot speak enough of this content; it stops me here; it is too much of joy: and this, and this, the greatest discords be they kiss.	0
i give you a sister whom i love more than a brother ever loved any sister .	0
and when i love thee not, chaos is come again.	0
i tell you ,  captain ,  if you look in the maps of the 'orld ,  i warrant you shall find ,  in the comparisons between macedon and monmouth ,  that the situations ,  look you ,  is both alike .	0
i’ll be there shortly .	0
what a strange drowsiness possesses them!	0
now he won’t give me either .	0
nobody come ?	0
what hast thou done ?	0
our fears in banquo stick deep, and in his royalty of nature reigns that which would be fear'd.	0
tybalt, the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting.	0
but though thou art adjudgèd to the death ,  and passèd sentence may not be recalled but to our honour’s great disparagement ,  yet will i favor thee in what i can .	0
i dreamt a dream to - night .	0
i hope those lions stay far away from him .	0
your reproof is something too round .	0
i believe i have some choice in the matter ,  sir .	0
it might, my lord.	0
fairies, be gone, and stay away.	0
but two months dead !	0
she is dead .	0
so cheer up .	0
come in ,  tailor .	0
i don’t believe that you deal justly with me.	0
she doth stray about by holy crosses ,  where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours .	0
and now methinks i have a mind to it .	0
that young man who was just here .	0
speak once again .	0
at our synagogue ,  tubal .	0
but with much forcing of his disposition .	0
yes ,  that i did; but that was but courtesy .	0
upon mine honor ,  myself ,  my brother ,  and this grievèd count did see her ,  hear her ,  at that hour last night talk with a ruffian at her chamber window who hath indeed ,  most like a liberal villain ,  confessed the vile encounters they have had a thousand times in secret .	0
i had rather be a toad, and live on the air of a dungeon, than keep a piece of the thing i love for others' uses.	0
wasn’t that nobly done?	0
a sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch ,  past speaking of in a king .	0
i wear it for a memorable honor ,  for i am welsh ,  you know ,  good countryman .	0
i did think ,  by the excellent constitution of thy leg ,  it was formed under the star of a galliard .	0
though cassio did only little wrong to him ,  as men in rage strike those that wish them best ,  yet surely cassio ,  i believe ,  received some strange insult from him that fled ,  which patience could not let him get away with .	0
he’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute ,  and i’ll go visit him .	0
if you deny me ,  fie upon your law— there is no force in the decrees of venice .	0
what revels are in hand ?	0
i once did hold it ,  as our statists do ,  a baseness to write fair ,  and labour'd much how to forget that learning; but ,  sir ,  now it did me yeoman's service .	0
in such a time as this it is not meet that every nice offense should bear his comment .	0
i’d be angry with you if the occasion allowed .	0
how are you ,  my golden girl ?	0
god's benison go with you and with those that would make good of bad and friends of foes !	0
he says your daughter’s not feeling well ,  my lord .	0
why dost thou use me thus ?	0
transparent helena !	0
no man must know .  ”  what follows ?	0
come, sit down, every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.	0
what will i do, thinkest thou?	0
but pardon me .	0
the time is so out of whack.	0
if you see anything else ,  let me know .	0
know you not ,  master ,  to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?	0
you know ,  you’re right .	0
i shall grow jealous of you shortly ,  launcelot ,  if you thus get my wife into corners .	0
i hid under this monster’s cloak to get out of the storm .	0
she’s dead ,  i think . —help ,  uncle ! —hero ,  why hero !	0
come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can . —come with me ,  my dear love .	0
perchance even there where i did find my doubts .	0
where is he ?	0
hang thee ,  young baggage !	0
oh ,  do - de ,  do - de ,  do - de .	0
he, woman; i say your husband.	0
with rosaline, my ghostly father?	0
i beg you, in your letters, when you shall tell about these unlucky deeds, speak of me as i am; nothing farfetched, and don’t write anything in malice.	0
look in on me then, and speak with me, or, naked as i am, i will attack you.	0
do not presume too much upon my love .	0
now that noble vessel is so full of grief ,  that it runs over ,  even from his eyes .	0
portia ,  what mean you ?	0
and let the laboring bark climb hills of seas olympus high, and duck again as low as hell's from heaven!	0
and, lips, o you the doors of breath, seal a timeless bargain with death, who will take everything, with a righteous kiss!	0
so full of artless jealousy is guilt it spills itself in fearing to be spilt .	0
because it doesn’t have eight ?	0
god bless you ,  sir .	0
sweet, don’t scorn her like that.	0
i am almost afraid to stand alone here in the churchyard; yet i will adventure .	0
do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?	0
lo ,  here i lie ,  never to rise again .	0
what antony shall speak, i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission, and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.	0
when marcus brutus grows so covetous to lock such rascal counters from his friends ,  be ready ,  gods ,  with all your thunderbolts ,  dash him to pieces !	0
the old toad is calling me .	0
is signior lucentio within ,  sir ?	0
that it should come to this!	0
would you do such a deed for all the world?	0
but who dare tell her so ?	0
come ,  we burn daylight ,  ho !	0
there he will come to know his destiny .	0
my daughter is still very young .	0
my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work ,  and says such baseness had never like executor .	0
brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels with the most boldest and best hearts of rome.	0
i know not, sweet.	0
what do you think ,  cassio ?	0
you’re right ,  that’s how it is .	0
shut up ,  you doddering old wizard !	0
pardon me, caesar; because my dear, dear love to your advancement bids me tell you this; and reason is responsible to my love.	0
how!	0
hey ,  open the door !	0
i’ll sell all my land .	0
not that ,  i hope ,  which you receiv'd of me .	0
peace yet again!	0
cicero one !	0
tybalt is dead, and romeo banished.’ that ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’ hath slain ten thousand tybalts.	0
i had been happy if the general camp, pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body, so i had nothing known.	0
but how long fairly shall her sweet life last ?	0
i saw bassanio and antonio part .	0
when i said that ,  i told you the truth .	0
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair .	0
what ,  not one hit ?	0
to the selfsame tune and words .	0
i’m here; what do you want ?	0
believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these  “ offers ”  are something real .	0
hey ,  mountain ,  hey !	0
yes, every one of them, and every man here respects you, and every one wishes you had that opinion of yourself which every noble roman has for you.	0
look ,  how our partner's rapt .	0
but how wilt thou do for a father?	0
thursday let it be— a thursday, tell her she shall be married to this noble earl.	0
o inhuman dog !	0
i will not do them wrong .	0
away!	0
which one of you have done this ?	0
when the sea is.	0
my countryman ,  but i still don’t know him .	0
why ,  what did i ?	0
o god, horatio, what a wounded name, things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!	0
come on ,  come on !	0
sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about my ears; and sometimes voices ,  that ,  if i then had wakened after long sleep ,  will make me sleep again: and then ,  in dreaming ,  the clouds i thought would open and show riches ready to drop on me; that ,  when i wakened ,  i cried to dream again .	0
keep it from leaving ,  marcellus .	0
i am but crazy north - north - west .	0
hence, be gone, away!	0
and my heart too .	0
won’t it be understood ,  when we have marked those sleepy two of his own chamber with blood ,  and used their very own daggers ,  that they have done it ?	0
tell us how it happened ,  noble casca .	0
hush !	0
a beast, no more.	0
did you know him?	0
please ,  give my regards to your mother ,  mrs .  peapod ,  and your father ,  mr .  peapod .	0
therefore i will depart unkissed .	0
if you ever loved your dear father — o god !	0
speak .	0
sent he to macduff?	0
they have a coin in england stamped with the figure of an angel ,  but that’s just engraved on the surface .	0
come on ,  put your sword away ,  my little soldier .	0
is it lost ?	0
what stops ?	0
your heart’s going to break .	0
it must be your imagination then ,  and not theirs .	0
one word more shall make me chide thee ,  if not hate thee .	0
thou liest .	0
good even to my ghostly confessor.	0
i know not, sir.	0
heaven knows what she has known .	0
where art thou ,  death ?	0
they’re looking for you in the great chamber .	0
their understanding begins to increase, and the approaching tide of understanding will shortly fill the reasonable shores of their minds that are now corrupt and muddy.	0
by the future .	0
that is the voice, or i am much mistaken, of portia.	0
you should listen to reason .	0
think’st thou the fiery fever will go out with titles blown from adulation ?	0
come ,  go we to the king .	0
if he be perjured ,  see you now ,  his reputation is as arrant a villain and a jack sauce as ever his black shoe trod upon god’s ground and his earth ,  in my conscience ,  la .	0
why, then othello and desdemona return again to venice.	0
may you die of the worst disease !	0
we’ll both be safer if we go separate ways .	0
but shall it be soon ?	0
i had rather be married to a death’s - head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these .	0
young son ,  it is arguably a distempered head that bids good morning so soon to your bed .	0
let’s follow ,  gertrude .	0
why can’t imagination trace the noble dust of alexander until he finds it stopping a wine barrel?	0
look how it steals away!	0
o most wicked fiend !	0
send thither to see.	0
gracious my lord ,  i should report that which i say i saw ,  but know not how to do it .	0
indeed you did ,  and more besides ,  miranda .	0
there is nothing in the world that i love as much as you .	0
he must die, and, for my part, i don’t know a personal cause to throw at him, but for the general complaints.	0
oh me!	0
perdition catch my soul, but i do love thee!	0
excellent wretch!	0
his forward voice now is speaking well of his friend; his backward voice is uttering dirty speeches and insults .	0
the more i hate him ,  the more he follows me around .	0
your love says ,  like an honest gentleman ,   ” where is your mother ?  ”  o god's lady dear !	0
lysander, look how i do quake with fear.	0
treason !	0
then music is sounds as the trumpets when true subjects bow to a new-crowned king; music is those sweet sounds at sunrise that creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear and summon him to marriage.	0
you will compel me ,  then ,  to read the will ?	0
here ,  here i will remain with the worms that are your maids .	0
now he tells how she brought him to my bedroom .	0
macduff is missing ,  and your noble son .	0
what man dost thou dig it for ?	0
ah - ha !	0
i wish your ladyship all heart's content.	0
someone deliver the order that buckingham be brought to salisbury .	0
where the bee sucks, there suck i: in a flower’s bell i lie; there i sleep when owls cry.	0
who does me this ?	0
do we but find the tyrant's power tonight, let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.	0
no, for then we should be colliers.	0
we will yet do well .	0
why ,  goodbye ,  portia .	0
great jove, othello guard, and swell his sail with thine own powerful breath, that he may bless this bay with his tall ship, make love's quick pants in desdemona's arms, give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits, and bring all cyprus comfort.	0
i’ll be your mirror, laertes.	0
where is my romeo ?	0
what ,  is the fellow mad ?	0
would you walk out with me ,  sir ? —oh ,  desdemona— yes ,  my lord ?	0
a most courteous exposition .	0
what a piece of work is man!	0
o villain ,  villain ,  smiling ,  damned villain !	0
if it’s that important ,  then let the women die .	0
at supper .	0
macbeth .	0
why dover ?	0
thank you for his present and your trouble .	0
here ,  sir !  ”  you stupid ,  unpolished dolts !	0
our hour  is fully out .	0
that’s a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins of my mother should be laid on me .	0
that is because the traitor murderer lives.	0
i’ve separated them into groups around the island ,  just as you ordered .	0
well ,  sir ,  i’ll take you to lear and have you stay with him a while .	0
bless us !	0
as they pass by ,  grab casca by the sleeve; and he’ll ,  in his sour way ,  tell you what notable events have happened today .	0
there is a poor old man who ,  purely out of love ,  has limped after me for miles .	0
here comes the lady .	0
i was hurt under your arm .	0
nought's had, all's spent, where our desire is got without content.	0
you know what ,  my lord ?	0
a piece of work that will make sick men whole .	0
that's a fault.	0
if they make you not then the better answer ,  you may say they are not the men you took them for .	0
a very handsome man .	0
and that clear honour were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer!	0
in his heart ?	0
why do you sharpen your knife so earnestly ?	0
let’s fall on our swords .	0
ride out to the horsemen on that hill .	0
prescribe not us our duty .	0
this is i, hamlet the dane.	0
what else?	0
i thank you .	0
away with the joint - stools ,  remove the court - cupboard ,  look to the plate .	0
i shall do’t ,  my lord .	0
i would to god all strifes were well compounded .	0
a dream itself is but a shadow.	0
the woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.	0
lend thy hand ,  and pluck my magic garment from me . —so: [lays down his cloak] [lays down his cloak] lie there ,  my art . —wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort .	0
but i'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.	0
oh ,  how i long to have some chat with her !	0
if e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine ,  thou and these woes were all for rosaline .	0
mad call i it ,  for ,  to define true madness ,  what is ’t but to be nothing else but mad ?	0
oh ,  my daughter !	0
now ,  most noble brutus ,  the gods today stand friendly ,  that we may ,  lovers in peace ,  lead on our days to age !	0
who must hang them ?	0
ay ,  sir ,  i thank god .	0
must i give way and room to your rash choler ?	0
shame on you ,  demetrius !	0
the wood of birnam .	0
come, we'll to sleep.	0
whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks; thou hast harp'd my fear aright.	0
i’ll have no halves .	0
is thy master coming?	0
that if you be sincere and truthful ,  your sincerity shouldn’t have any talks to your beauty .	0
there comes an old man and his three sons— i could match this beginning with an old tale .	0
you have done a deed ,  i don’t care about your sword; i'll make you famous ,  although i lose twenty lives .	0
i swear— by nothing ,  because this is no oath .	0
fit to govern !	0
good morrow ,  sweet hero .	0
please, spare me.	0
why ,  that’s the way to fool their preparation and to conquer their most absurd intents .	0
well, god protect you!	0
i’ve only been hurt ,  not killed .	0
why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?	0
a surgeon !	0
get me some ink and paper ,  and hire some horses to ride .	0
by this hand ,  they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him .	0
if we crown him ,  i have to admit we’d be giving him the power to do damage .	0
take the fool away .	0
what ,  ho ,  brabantio !	0
he calls to horse ,  but will i know not whither .	0
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?	0
get me ink and paper ,  and hire post horses .	0
hail ,  brave friend !	0
in god’s name ,  what art thou ?	0
why looks your grace so heavily today ?	0
they vanished strangely .	0
i believe drink gave you the lie last night.	0
it's true, good lieutenant.	0
our guiding light is out .	0
oh ,  in this love ,  you love your child so badly ,  that you go mad ,  even though she is in heaven .	0
i have come to announce that juno has asked you ,  ceres ,  goddess of the fields and the earth ,  to leave your rich farms of wheat ,  rye ,  barley ,  oats ,  and peas ,  the hills where the	0
only he acted from honesty and for the general good .	0
how i dote on thee !	0
there was a time when i would have been terrified by a shriek in the night ,  and the hair on my skin would have stood up when i heard a ghost story .	0
if one knight give a— would you have a love song or a song of good life ?	0
alas ,  how shall this bloody deed be answer'd ?	0
i’ll have glory in this losing day—more than octavius and mark antony will gain by their foul conquest .	0
no .	0
i believe drink did all of this to you last night .	0
please don’t ,  sir .	0
this hasn’t reached the level of an egyptian feast yet .	0
but i pray you ergo ,  old man ,  ergo ,  i beseech you ,  talk you of young master launcelot .	0
i would not for the world they saw thee here .	0
can you do me greater harm than hate ?	0
i fear my thisbe’s promise is forgot ! — and thou ,  o wall ,  o sweet ,  o lovely wall ,  that stand’st between her father’s ground and mine .	0
a thing for me?	0
is it the king ?	0
i know her father ,  though i know not her ,  and he knew my deceasèd father well .	0
this is as't should be .	0
my language!	0
yea ,  and text underneath:  “ here dwells benedick the married man ”  ?	0
if its juice is put on someone’s eyelids while they’re asleep ,  that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .	0
i have charged thee not to haunt about my doors .	0
no more ,  no more .	0
give him this, and tell him keep it better than the other one.	0
who is here so vile that will not love his country ?	0
it’s almost fairy time .	0
come on, shall we go?	0
oh yes ,  i heard them all ,  and more ,  too .	0
the grave where she’s buried ,  that is also her womb ,  and ,  from her womb ,  we find children of diverse kinds when we are sucking on her natural bosom; many plants are excellent for many virtues ,  some have none ,  others have some ,  but are all different .	0
wilt thou rest damned ?	0
find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as i loved hero and ask	0
didst thou behold octavia ?	0
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious ,  which so appearing to the common eyes ,  we shall be called purgers ,  not murderers .	0
neglected ,  rather ,  and then when poisoned hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge .	0
i did enact julius caesar; i was killed i' the capitol; brutus killed me .	0
now ,  before god ,  i am so annoyed that every part about me quivers .	0
stand from the hearse ,  stand from the body .	0
am i like such a fellow?	0
i wonder if the lion be to speak.	0
this shall make our purpose necessary and not envious, which so appearing to the common eyes, we shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.	0
it was .	0
here’s yet some liquor left .	0
we are their parents and original .	0
in both my eyes he doubly sees himself: in each eye ,  one:—swear by your double self ,  and there's an oath of credit .	0
the moon shines bright:—in such a night as this ,  when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees ,  and they did make no noise , —in such a night ,  troilus ,  methinks ,  mounted the trojan walls ,  and sigh'd his soul toward the grecian tents ,  where cressid lay that night .	0
am not i your lord ?	0
come what come may, [aside.	0
where ?	0
what, nurse, i say!	0
are we cuckolds, ere we have deserv'd it?	0
you shall not write my praise .	0
how many times will caesar bleed in amusement ,  that lies now next to pompey's statue ,  no worthier than the dust !	0
look ,  where he comes .	0
thank your stars that you’re brutus that speaks this way, or, by the gods, this speech would be your last.	0
peace ,  i have done .	0
has anyone seen cesario ?	0
or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .	0
no; we shall never win a bet at that sport.	0
nurse, where's my daughter?	0
unfought withal ,  but i will sell my dukedom to buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm in that nook - shotten isle of albion .	0
do not you chide .	0
what said he ?	0
leonato and his brother .	0
well said .	0
what we have to worry about is a full - scale invasion from scotland—always an unreliable neighbor .	0
who's within ?	0
to cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there .	0
ring the alarum bell !	0
oh sisters three ,  come ,  come to me ,  with hands as pale as milk; lay them in gore ,  since you have shore with shears his thread of silk .	0
you both are rivals, and love hermia; and now both rivals, to mock helena.	0
wait for mine ,  sweet soul .	0
most shallow man .	0
at land indeed thou dost o’ercount me of my father’s house ,  but since the cuckoo builds not for himself ,  remain in ’t as thou mayst .	0
stephano is my name, and i bring word that my mistress will be here at belmont before the break of day; she wanders about by holy crosses, where she kneels and prays for happy marriage hours.	0
i bother you too much ,  but you’re willing .	0
he was my friend ,  faithful and just to me .	0
and ,  for his passage ,  the soldiers' music and the rites of war speak loudly for him .	0
let’s pray that we never come into conflict like that again .	0
please let me go .	0
i swear to god i’ll get revenge .	0
so is the most difficult loss .	0
hers you are .	0
look ,  sir ,  i’m bleeding .	0
he’s of the color of the nutmeg .	0
and now it looks like you need my help .	0
what, is antonio here?	0
no ,  sir .	0
don’t believe it .	0
i will be flesh and blood ,  for there was never yet philosopher that could endure the toothache patiently ,  however they have writ the style of gods and made a push at chance and sufferance .	0
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .	0
all eyes!	0
tell me thine first .	0
a gentleman ,  nurse ,  that loves to hear himself talk ,  and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .	0
no, indeed, they are not.	0
dost thou think so ,  spirit ?	0
the day ,  my friends ,  and everything await me .	0
i’d rather be a peddler .	0
but tell me what you’re fighting about .	0
mark antony ,  here ,  take you caesar's body .	0
what unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?	0
turn thy back and run?	0
for that kind of relief ,  the patient must heal herself .	0
queen margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .	0
she cannot love nor take no shape nor project of affection she is so self - endeared .	0
the world’s huge .	0
question it ,  horatio .	0
look to the queen there ,  ho !	0
then god be blessed ,  it is the blessèd sun .	0
thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him .	0
if you thrive well ,  bring them to baynard’s castle ,  where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well - learnèd bishops .	0
o madam ,  madam ,  madam !	0
i beg you ,  don’t let my jealousies be your dishonors ,  only my own safeties .	0
who will bear the guilt for our great slaughter?	0
most humbly therefore bending to your state, i crave fit disposition for my wife, due reference of place and exhibition, with such accommodation and besort as levels with her breeding.	0
only in them, nature's copy is not eternal.	0
no ,  let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp ,  and crook the pregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning .	0
fair lovers ,  you are fortunately met .	0
will you give her up ?	0
who knocks so hard ?	0
yes ,  he is dead .	0
clink your cups together in a toast !	0
o ,  why rebuke you him that loves you so ?	0
in such a night young lorenzo swore he loved her well, stealing her soul with many vows of love,— and never a true one.	0
honest lord, what you say is true, because some of you there present are worse than devils.	0
i’m not a traitor ,  unfair lady .	0
so go out there and give him what he wants .	0
hail to your majesty .	0
i saw that .	0
the rest shall keep as they are .	0
count the clock .	0
i said your husband .	0
out, loathed medicine!	0
gracious king, if it pleases you, we will bestow ourselves.	0
why ,  how can you ,  hamlet !	0
when we were boys, who would believe that there were mountaineers covered with dew like bulls, who had throats with pockets of flesh hanging from them?	0
approach ,  rich ceres ,  to entertain her .	0
what it is, my caius, i’ll tell you, as we are walking, as to whom it must be done.	0
knock ,  knock !	0
it’s strange ,  my theseus ,  the story that these lovers speak of .	0
it may be so .	0
i don’t think he wants to be disturbed .	0
you shall have leave .	0
i’ve acted like such a villain !	0
man delights not me—no, nor woman nei- ther, though by your smiling you seem to say so.	0
well ,  you are gone both ways .	0
you are a fool; go to.	0
o ,  most wicked speed ,  to post with such dexterity to incestuous sheets !	0
come help me bless this couple ,  so they will be prosperous and have many children .	0
nor from mine own weak merits will i draw the smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; for she had eyes and chose me .	0
every day you get me out of the way with some plan ,  iago; and rather ,  as it seems to me now ,  keep from me all convenience than supplies me with the least advantage of hope .	0
will you cry ?	0
to sebastian] temperance was a delicate wench .	0
that’s sides and heart .	0
bring in my lord .	0
come on ,  nerissa ,  i want to go see this man who’s come so courteously .	0
herald ,  spare yourself .	0
but ignore that .	0
no more !	0
i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth ,  these words are natural breath .	0
prithee ,  go in thyself .	0
i have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter.	0
as i suck blood ,  i will some mercy show .	0
i think she stirs again.	0
i do know, when passion burns the blood, how the wasteful soul gives the tongue vows to speak.	0
oh ,  please be quiet .	0
scurvy knave !	0
hell is murky.	0
seyton !	0
the very instant that i saw you did my heart fly to your service ,  there resides to make me slave to it ,  and for your sake am i this patient log - man .	0
indeed ,  it is a strange - disposed time; but men may construe things after their fashion ,  clean from the purpose of the things themselves .	0
actually ,  sweet love ,  i was just coming to your house .	0
i should know that voice .	0
now sir ,  this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminent in the degree of this fortune as cassio does ?	0
she can’t hurt you ,  helena .	0
no ,  no; he's gone .	0
what committed !	0
go after him and try to calm him down a little .	0
give me my sin again .	0
for if but once thou show me thy grey light ,  i'll find demetrius ,  and revenge this spite .	0
remember thee ?	0
who knows if donalbain be with his brother?	0
tis paltry to be caesar .	0
now much beshrew my manners and my pride, if hermia meant to say lysander lied!	0
our duty to your honor.	0
how can they refuse to speak with me ?	0
like a young man who wants to amount to something ,  this morning begins early .	0
the play’s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .	0
his majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the  you’re being arrested ?	0
follow my mother .	0
i’d rather lie in the nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me ,  making me disgusting .	0
i’ll prove mine honor and mine honesty against thee presently if thou dar’st stand .	0
hall to you, lady!	0
now i’ve said it twice .	0
what’s going on ?	0
my lord sebastian ,  the truth you speak lacks some gentleness and proper timing; you rub the wound ,  when you should bring the band - aid .	0
heaven make thee free of it !	0
the reports came in as thick as hail and every one of them sang your praises in your great defense of the kingdom ,  and poured such praises down before the king .	0
is there none here to give the woman ?	0
then tell me if this might be a brother .	0
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks: they'll be in scarlet straight at any news.	0
and come yourselves and bring messala with you immediately to us.	0
did he receive you well ?	0
ha ,  ha ,  ha !	0
take on someone your own size: if you kill me ,  boy ,  you’ll have killed a man .	0
my being in egypt ,  caesar ,  what was ’t to you ?	0
thou shouldst be honest .	0
you have bested many things ,  well don’t try and best me .	0
coward !	0
set on ,  and leave no ceremony out .	0
what is't o'clock ?	0
marry ,  my child ,  early next thursday morn the gallant ,  young ,  and noble gentleman ,  the county paris ,  at saint peter's church ,  shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .	0
o me, lieutenant!	0
what satisfaction can you have tonight?	0
my lord, we will not.	0
please it your grace lead on ?	0
come here ,  sir andrew .	0
wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck ?	0
look to the bak'd meats ,  good angelica; spare not for cost .	0
i don’t understand you ,  my lord .	0
if she glares ,  i’ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew .	0
do so; and after two days, i will set you free.	0
what in the contrary ?	0
you’re wrong ,  you madman .	0
o curse of marriage ,  that we can call these delicate creatures ours ,  and not their appetites !	0
it’s midnight .	0
caesar wouldn’t take the crown; it’s certain he wasn’t ambitious for that reason .	0
most mighty caesar, let me know some reason, in case i’m laughed at when i tell them so.	0
a thursday be it then .	0
what do you say ?	0
mine ear ,  i thank it ,  brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?	0
look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can’t be awoken !	0
what else do you see in the old, dark, bottomless pit of time?	0
well ,  let's go ,  and tell macbeth how much we did .	0
ah ,  for our father ,  for our dear lord clarence !	0
get thee gone ,  and hire those horses .	0
i had rather be a dog ,  and howl the moon ,  than be such a roman .	0
so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce ,  set hyssop and weed up thyme ,  supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many—either to have it sterile with idleness ,  or manured with industry—why ,  the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills .	0
you stand amazed ,  but be of comfort .	0
i shall return before your lordship thence .	0
why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, osric.	0
come here ,  catesby .	0
o my lord!	0
what noise is here?	0
i have a letter guessingly set down ,  which came from one that’s of a neutral heart ,  and not from one opposed .	0
then gave i her ,  according to my craft with herbs ,  a sleeping potion; which took effect as i intended ,  for it made her seem dead .	0
we speak no treason ,  man .	0
and here stands all your state: either be gone before the watch be set ,  or by the break of day disguised from hence .	0
hello ,  sir .	0
come on and kiss me ,  kate .	0
but if you do ,  sir ,  i am for you .	0
lorenzo and his infidel?	0
that’s a question .	0
sit down; because you must now know more.	0
but i don’t remember coming here.	0
if this had not been a gentlewoman ,  she should have been buried out o' christian burial .	0
the demon hoppedance is in tom’s belly ,  crying for some fish to eat .	0
in his lawless fit, behind the arras hearing something stir, whips out his rapier, cries 'a rat, a rat!	0
we go around the globe, swifter than the wandering moon.	0
that will never be.	0
or else misgraffed in respect of years— o spite!	0
soldier ,  you must come to the king .	0
if this letter move him not ,  his legs cannot .	0
come ,  we'll in here ,  tarry for the mourners ,  and stay dinner .	0
they have made worms' meat of me .	0
i am invisible; and i will overhear their conference .	0
i wonder none of you have thought of him .	0
you’ll be sick tomorrow for this night’s watching .	0
there are no old gentlemen but gardeners ,  ditchers ,  and grave - makers .	0
behold ,  the chests stand there ,  noble prince: if you choose the one that i am contained in ,  our marriage vows will be solemnized right away; but if you fail ,  my lord ,  you must be gone from here immediately without any more talking .	0
those that have known the earth so full of faults.	0
certainly ,  sir ,  i can .	0
you’re so attractive when you smile .	0
ha ?	0
give me your hands, if we be friends, and robin shall restore amends.	0
let’s stay and hear the will !	0
my lord ,  we were sent for .	0
are they married, think you?	0
for me ,  three thousand ducats .	0
i should ev'n die with pity to see another thus .	0
the one that doesn’t work has the more delicate sense.	0
come, cassius' sword, and find titinius' heart.	0
nothing at all ,  yet all that i see is .	0
comes the king forth ,  i pray you ?	0
come ,  my lord .	0
murder ,  murder !	0
hell is murky!	0
i’d better stop up my ears against this siren’s song .	0
companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .	0
down !	0
i shook you and shouted at you ,  sir .	0
by and by .	0
a calendar ,  a calendar !	0
come on .	0
no .	0
marry ,  you may partly hope that your father got you not ,  that you are not the jew’s daughter .	0
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift.	0
well ,  we’ll see your behavior .	0
that’s a degree to love .	0
unhappy fortune !	0
here ,  signior tranio ,  this bird you aimed at ,  though you hit her not . — therefore a health to all that shot and missed .	0
o, i am fortune's fool!	0
i ,  beyond all limit of what else i'th’ world ,  do love ,  prize ,  honour you .	0
no ,  not much moved .	0
look ,  he stirs .	0
who else ?	0
here ,  peter quince .	0
yet brutus says he was ambitious; and brutus is an honorable man .	0
toad, that has spent thirty one days and nights under cold stone, from whose sweat a sleeping venom was gotten, boil you first in the charmed pot!	0
nothing more than that ?	0
caliban !	0
it is the best horse of europe .	0
do not muse at me ,  my most worthy friends .	0
but ,  since the affairs of men still seem uncertain ,  let's think about the worst that can happen .	0
o comfortable friar !	0
but hear you: methought you said, you neither lend nor borrow, upon advantage.	0
we’ll meet macbeth there .	0
dear maid, kind sister, sweet ophelia!	0
o, how my heart hates to hear his name, and i can’t present myself to him, to vent the love i had for my cousin tybalt upon the body of the man that has slaughtered him!	0
bad luck ,  bad luck ?	0
it is the cry of women ,  my good lord .	0
he looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .	0
for our losses ,  his exchequer is too poor; for th' effusion of our blood ,  the muster of his kingdom too faint a number; and for our disgrace ,  his own person ,  kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction .	0
nor i; my spirits are nimble.	0
i have none .	0
if you do, by mary, i’ll give you this curse for your wedding gift: whether you as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, you shalt not escape slander.	0
farewell.	0
that?	0
give me a case to put my visage in.	0
o, don’t be afraid of me.	0
i’m so sorry .	0
they shall speak more ,  for now i am determined to know the worst by the worst means .	0
the sky ,  it seems ,  would pour down stinking pitch ,  but that the sea ,  mounting to th’ welkin's cheek ,  dashes the fire out .	0
so i am free .	0
the handkerchief!	0
you see how simple and how fond i am .	0
how ?	0
what ?	0
that’s just how he is .	0
the news accuses the speaker; each minute turns up a new one .	0
farewell .	0
i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you .	0
angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.	0
graze where you will, you shall not house with me.	0
we have here recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that ever was known in the commonwealth .	0
none but his enemies.	0
then away she started to deal with grief alone .	0
he poisons him in the garden for his estate.	0
bring me word how tall she is .	0
where is that viper ?	0
to find you .	0
yes ,  but now there’s no way to calm him down .	0
but i smile at swords ,  laugh scornfully at weapons ,  brandished by man that's been given birth by a woman .	0
i pray you stand good father to me now .	0
now do you know the reason of this haste .	0
do i entice you ?	0
romeo is hateful ,  even though god isn’t .	0
cassius ,  go you into the other street and part the numbers .	0
only yesterday ,  the word of caesar might have stood against the world .	0
oh night ,  which ever is when day is not !	0
a sleeve ?	0
if he loves caesar ,  all that he can do is what he can do to himself — think and die for caesar .	0
lady ,  did you sleep in her room last night ?	0
and ,  for your life ,  let justice be blamed .	0
women ,  dress me like a queen .	0
what mercy can you render him ,  antonio ?	0
my heart is wonderfully light since this same wayward girl is so reformed .	0
alas ,  the day !	0
what else ?	0
what ,  are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it ?	0
i’ll ask that again; for nothing can be wrong if she is well.	0
good - bye ,  my lord .	0
verona's summer does not have such a flower of a man .	0
thy shape invisible retain thou still .	0
what should it be ,  that they so shriek abroad ?	0
i would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant i could escape your scorn and constant harassment .	0
those his goodly eyes ,  that o’er the files and musters of the war have glowed like plated mars ,  now bend ,  now turn the office and devotion of their view upon a tawny front .	0
curse me ,  but i love her heartily; because she is wise ,  if i can judge her ,  and she is beautiful ,  if my eyes can really see ,  and she is true ,  as she has proved herself; and so ,  like herself ,  wise ,  beautiful ,  and true ,  she shall be placed in my faithful soul .	0
i cannot speak any beginning to this peevish odds ,  and would in action glorious i had lost those legs that brought me to a part of it .	0
until i know it is done, however great my luck, my joys can never begin.	0
into what dangers would you lead me ,  cassius ,  that you would have me seek into myself for that which is not in me ?	0
what’s important is to be prepared .	0
but here they come .	0
why, bride!	0
let it go all.	0
take a little vacation in mantua .	0
the more i hate him, the more he follows me around.	0
for you know ,  nuncle ,  the hedge - sparrow fed the cuckoo so long ,  that it’s had it head bit off by it young .	0
your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .	0
peter ,  stay at the gate .	0
my husband!	0
but did you see them dead ?	0
hamlet comes back .	0
hurry up ,  make haste ,  for it grows very late .	0
men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they’re away from home .	0
so let him land ,  and solemnly see him set on to london .	0
farewell ,  you group of spirits; i have to get going .	0
then heaven have mercy on me !	0
call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play upon me.	0
may god give their souls rest .	0
i wish i might only see that man again !	0
then is there mirth in heaven when earthly things ,  made even ,  atone together .	0
come down .	0
both ,  both ,  my girl .	0
did diana ever beautify a grove as much as kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements ?	0
sweet ,  so would i .	0
that’s not so ,  my lord ,  i am too much in the sun .	0
look ,  here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers .	0
i saw her burial in her relative's vault, and the i rushed to tell you.	0
you are welcome ,  gentlemen !	0
my door is lock’d .	0
demetrius ,  i'll avouch it to his head ,  made love to nedar's daughter ,  helena ,  and won her soul; and she ,  sweet lady ,  dotes ,  devoutly dotes ,  dotes in idolatry ,  upon this spotted and inconstant man .	0
no, before the sun advances his burning eye, to cheer the day and to dry night's dank dew, i must fill up this, our cage made of reeds with baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.	0
why ,  revenge .	0
very like a whale .	0
how shall we find the concord of this discord ?	0
my lord, i would that thursday were to-morrow.	0
you’re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?	0
thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory, and heard a mermaid, on a dolphin's back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, that the rude sea grew civil at her song, and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the sea-maid's music.	0
o, heaven forgive us!	0
but you’re not going to deliver it ,  are you ?	0
yes ,  they do ,  my lord ,  hercules and his load too .	0
within this hour my man shall be with thee and bring thee cords made like a tackled stair ,  which to the high topgallant of my joy must be my convoy in the secret night .	0
admired miranda!	0
sir ,  i make my living using an awl .	0
tell me in sadness, who is that you love?	0
feeling the loss so much ,  i can’t help but weep for the friend forever .	0
by god ,  i wouldn’t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me ,  i think—not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory .	0
what, jealous oberon!	0
still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind ,  says ,   “ suum ,  mun ,  nonny .  ”  dauphin my boy ,  my boy ,  cessez .	0
damn it ,  you’re not listening to me !	0
and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.	0
we’re safe from my father for at least three hours .	0
you will soon hear more .	0
what!	0
let it be so.	0
i am the very man— i’ll see that straight .	0
i kiss'd thee ere i kill'd thee.	0
all that served brutus ,  i will entertain them .	0
i’m coming to end your pursuit of me and leave me to my grief .	0
o god !	0
no ,  believe me .	0
why ,  look you ,  how you storm !	0
what ,  my young lady and mistress ?	0
to caesar will i render my legions and my horse .	0
what would you do about it ?	0
i have never been so weary ,  never so sad ,  wet from the dew ,  and torn with briers; i can’t crawl any further .	0
do ,  young sir .	0
juliet ,  on thursday early will i rouse ye .	0
many thanks ,  signior gremio .	0
i do ,  with all my heart; and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart .	0
only to your own satisfaction .	0
i think one of them is nearby and can’t get away .	0
an it shall please you to break up this, it shall seem to signify.	0
by his side lies the noble earl of suffolk ,  york’s comrade and equal in brave wounds .	0
i’ll cry at nothing ,  and i’ll always do it when you’re in a good mood .	0
sirrah, fetch drier logs.	0
say, voltimand, what news from our ally, norway?	0
it seems that you scorn me .	0
what have we here?	0
death ,  which has taken her away to make me cry ,  now ties up my tongue and won’t let me speak .	0
i carry no hatred ,  holy man ,  because my request will benefit my enemy .	0
i warrant thee my man's as true as steel .	0
how now ,  my lord !	0
but manhood is melted into curtsies ,  valor into compliment ,  and men are only turned into tongue ,  and trim ones too .	0
i serve the king ,  who sent me here .	0
my murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of birnam gets up and moves ,  and i will be king for my entire natural life .	0
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .	0
so get prepared .	0
behave as we would in denmark .	0
what villain ,  madam ?	0
my lord ,  it shall be done .	0
we came hither to fight with you .	0
where are these hearts?	0
a rhyme i learn'd even now of one i danc'd withal.	0
listen .	0
when i strike ,  i’ll cry ,   “ all or nothing !  ”  well put .	0
where's peaseblossom ?	0
a madness most discreet ,  a choking acid ,  and a preserving sweet .	0
therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends ,  and there an end .	0
tell them to capture me ,  then sell my bones .	0
don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .	0
the games are done, and caesar is returning.	0
stand there!	0
nay ,  certainly ,  i have heard the ptolemies’ pyramises are very goodly things .	0
you told me she got them ,  and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon ,  but nothing like that ever happens .	0
my brave spirit !	0
i must catechise you for it ,  madonna .	0
i swear that it is so very, very late that we should call it early by and by.	0
i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol.	0
now heaven walks on earth .	0
take in the topsail .	0
but we both obey, and here give up ourselves, in the full bent, to lay our service freely at your feet, to be commanded.	0
you can play no part but pyramus; for pyramus is a sweet - faced man; a proper man ,  as one shall see in a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman - like man; therefore you must needs play pyramus .	0
our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for rome .	0
oh ,  that a lady of one man refused should therefore be abused by another !	0
sir ,  in algiers .	0
gentle mercutio ,  put up your sword .	0
the foul fiend follows me !	0
well ,  well ,  well .	0
this is not brutus ,  friend ,  but ,  i assure you ,  a prize no less in worth .	0
there’s not a nobler man in rome than antony .	0
the coroner has decided, and finds it christian burial.	0
here comes other reck'nings .	0
this is the matter—nurse ,  give leave awhile ,  we must talk in secret .	0
who intercepts my expedition ?	0
the advancement of your children ,  gentle lady .	0
i should not see the sandy hour - glass run ,  but i should think of shallows and of flats; and see my wealthy andrew dock'd in sand ,  vailing her high - top lower than her ribs ,  to kiss her burial .	0
did he confess it ?	0
here come the lovers ,  full of joy and mirth .	0
his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract .	0
stay you, good gentlemen.	0
if i have killed the issue of your womb ,  to quicken your increase i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter .	0
to feed were best at home; from thence ,  the sauce to meat is ceremony; meeting were bare without it .	0
o mistake ,  soon conceived ,  you never come to a happy birth ,  only kill the mother that had you !	0
oh ,  here comes the storm again .	0
to her, my lord, was i betroth'd ere i saw hermia.	0
they can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true .	0
whence is that knocking?	0
return you to my sister .	0
i did nothing .	0
make no noise ,  make no noise .	0
lie on her ?	0
you may do your will ,  but he's a tried and valiant soldier .	0
look out ,  he’s coming !	0
the will, the will!	0
nothing ,  my lord .	0
tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, has sent a letter to his father's house.	0
i do wander everywhere  swifter than the moon’s sphere .	0
i have to ask you something.	0
this box was tested in the fire seven times .	0
i will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players.	0
fire and brimstone !	0
what bout your thought ,  iago ?	0
put your sword away .	0
he’s lying dead in a ditch ,  with twenty deep gashes in his head ,  any one of which would have been enough to kill him .	0
my pleading is out of tune right now; my lord is not my lord; and i wouldn’t know him if he were he in favor as changed in disposition.	0
how are you, my lord!	0
to kill him ,  clitus .	0
stand next to me for a while, because someone is coming hastily.	0
i come, anon.—but if thou meanest not well, i do beseech thee— madam!	0
has he ,  masters ?	0
we’ll go forward with you and meet them at philippi .	0
passion!	0
dispute it like a man .	0
how ,  how ,  how ,  how ?	0
well ,  i disagree .	0
mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not endure a further view .	0
and would i have ever done that to you ?	0
little again !	0
these letters give ,  iago ,  to the pilot ,  and by him do my duties to the senate .	0
he ,  being remiss ,  most generous and free from all contriving ,  will not peruse the foils; so that with ease ,  or with a little shuffling ,  you may choose a sword unbated ,  and in a pass of practice ,  requite him for your father .	0
let us not leave him out .	0
though this island seem to be desert—	0
what do you want to tell me ?	0
what's the matter ,  that you unlace your reputation thus ,  and spend your rich opinion for the name of a nightbrawler ?	0
was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself ?	0
get ready ,  my lord .	0
the body is with the king ,  but the king is not with the body .	0
to adrian] [to sebastian] why, in good time.	0
he is close to death ,  but not dead yet .	0
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks; and for myself— my virtue or my plague ,  be it either which— she's so conjunctive to my life and soul that ,  as the star moves not but in his sphere ,  i could not but by her .	0
get some rest ,  tonight we'll feast together .	0
if they will fight with us ,  bid them come down ,  or void the field .	0
and so ,  good morning to all of you .	0
a shall recover his wits there; or, if a do not, 'tis no great matter there.	0
what a full fortune does the thicklips owe, if he can carry't thus!	0
i see that you don’t know me.	0
don’t talk to me ,  because i won’t answer you .	0
your fortunes are alike .	0
i’ll have none of your money .	0
and ,  being done ,  thus wall away doth go .	0
my noble father ,  i do perceive here a divided duty .	0
treat desdemona well .	0
now ,  balthazar ,  as i have ever found thee honest true ,  so let me find thee still .	0
the army is ready .	0
but make amends now .	0
is it possible ?	0
noses, ears, and lips.	0
oh ,  but i think of him more highly than i say i do—and i wish he looked worse in other women’s eyes .	0
come, let's do so, because every minute is to expect more arrival.	0
oh ,  most lame and impotent conclusion !	0
by what ?	0
the english force, so please you.	0
i'll be thy second .	0
some tender money to me; some invite me; some other give me thanks for kindnesses; some offer me commodities to buy .	0
aside.	0
go to adriana ,  you scoundrel ,  and quickly .	0
come ,  bring me to where they are .	0
the great emperor caesar ,  dead and turned to clay ,  might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .	0
sweet friends ,  to bed .	0
she’s gone forever .	0
he has almost supp'd .	0
i do think scotland is sinking under macbeth’s oppression .	0
now i'll tell you without asking .	0
can he vent trinculos?	0
me too ,  lieutenant .	0
she blushes at the slightest thing .	0
you’re a liar !	0
in this last tempest .	0
only a mind that's honest could share some of this woe ,  although the main part pertains to you alone .	0
it used to be that when you knocked a man’s brains out he would just die ,  and that would be it .	0
listen ,  listen ,  someone is knocking .	0
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me .	0
know thus far north.	0
wherefore speaks he this to her he hates ?	0
bernardo ?	0
that's not true .	0
in parthia i took you prisoner; and then i made you swear, since i saved your life, that whatever i asked you to do, you should attempt it.	0
i say, we will have no more marriages.	0
a pack of blessings light upon thy back ,  happiness courts thee in her best array ,	0
the king is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers ,  the father of his son ,  nor the master of his servant ,  for they purpose not their death ,  when they purpose their services .	0
now i will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .	0
hence!	0
my mistress ,  dearest ,  and i thus humble ever .	0
oh ,  heaven help me !	0
hamlet!	0
as from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites, to countenance this horror!	0
or, rather, do i not, in plainest truth, tell you i do not and cannot love you?	0
oh ,  kiss me through the hole of this vile wall .	0
the meats baked for the funeral were also put on the marriage tables.	0
i will not be sworn but love may transform me to an oyster ,  but i’ll take my oath on it ,  till he have made an oyster of me ,  he shall never make me such a fool .	0
look !	0
sleep dwell upon your eyes ,  peace in your breast !	0
no ,  you have to call me rosalind . —sister ,  you’re coming ?	0
thou hast got more hair on thy chin than dobbin my phill - horse has on his tail .	0
where i have learned me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests ,  and am enjoined by holy lawrence to fall prostrate here to beg your pardon .	0
i'll come to you in a minute .	0
how satisfied ,  my lord ?	0
he found it then; i never gave it him .	0
this may flies do, when i from this must fly; they are free men, but i am banished.	0
i am for the air .	0
nay ,  i dare not swear it .	0
be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd, bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, be thy intents wicked or charitable, thou comest in such a questionable shape that i will speak to thee.	0
how should they, when wise men have no eyes?	0
and so she did.	0
too much of water hast thou, poor ophelia, and therefore i forbid my tears; but yet it is our trick; nature her custom holds, let shame say what it will.	0
go and importune her .	0
i really like the work.	0
and weep ye now ,  seeing she is advanced above the clouds ,  as high as heaven itself ?	0
who wouldn’t get sad thinking about things like that ?	0
mercutio ,  you hang out with romeo .	0
are not you lysander ?	0
how do you all at verona ?	0
you do their work for them and give them good luck .	0
how have i behaved, that he might put the smallest opinion on my least misconduct?	0
will you hear some music ,  my sweet love ?	0
true !	0
he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.	0
for the queen ,  i’ll take her to my guard .	0
it’s so simple !	0
here is more news .	0
ay ,  amen !	0
then i'll look up; my fault is past .	0
yes ,  but i’m afraid you speak out of torture ,  where men will say anything .	0
i see thou know’st me not .	0
i’ll follow thee and make a heaven of hell ,  to die upon the hand i love so well .	0
here i kneel: if e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love ,  either in discourse of thought or actual deed ,  or that mine eyes ,  mine ears ,  or any sense ,  delighted them ,  or any other form ,  or that i do not yet ,  and ever did ,	0
i only think of the world as the world ,  gratiano; a stage ,  where every man must play a part ,  and my part is a sad one .	0
you are in a perilous state ,  shepherd .	0
welcome ,  iago .	0
what is a traitor?	0
ay ,  he was porn at monmouth ,  captain gower .	0
this letter he early bid me give his father, and threat'ned me with death, going in the vault, if i departed not and left him there.	0
my reputation, iago, my reputation!	0
no ,  sir .	0
i will reward your loyalty.	0
is love a tender thing?	0
my countryman ,  but yet i know him not .	0
tell me .	0
all right ,  then .	0
help me ,  my women !	0
th' ambassadors from norway ,  my good lord ,  are joyfully returned .	0
are all thy conquests ,  glories ,  triumphs ,  spoils ,  shrunk to this little measure ?	0
oh god ,  he’s murdered his master !	0
your last guess is right .	0
do not swear at all .	0
no.	0
gone?	0
i will pour some in [caliban drinks] thy other mouth.	0
here, sir, is a ring she asked me give you, sir.	0
but there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while .	0
what speech, my good lord?	0
come on ,  shall we go ?	0
worthy macbeth ,  we are waiting for you .	0
now, good sweet nurse, o lord, why do you look sad?	0
this grave shall have a living monument .	0
i’d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .	0
peace ,  children ,  peace .	0
i’ll ride home tomorrow ,  sir toby .	0
your drugs are quick.	0
stay hidden and listen .	0
eat where you can ,  you won’t live with me .	0
he lays it on.	0
or is he on his horse ?	0
yes ,  leeks are good .	0
indeed they are disproportion'd; my letters say a hundred and seven galleys.	0
from this moment the very firstlings of my heart shall be the firstlings of my hand .	0
why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?	0
nay ,  when i have a suit wherein i mean to touch your love indeed it shall be full of poise and difficult weight and fearful to be granted .	0
now you know why we’re in a hurry.	0
may the heavens make our presence and our practices pleasant and helpful to him!	0
our duty to your honour.	0
never excuse; for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed .	0
i am still a virgin; i have never gone back on my word, scarcely have wanted what was my own, at no time broke a promise, would not betray the devil to his fellow, and delight more in truth than life.	0
well this was signor benedick that said so .	0
sweet sir toby ,  be patient for tonight .	0
you’re in the charge of an honorable man .	0
ride, ride, messala, ride, and give these bills to the legions on the other side.	0
that death's unnatural that kills for loving.	0
if you ever did hold me in your heart, stay away from happy things for a while, and, in this harsh world, draw your breath in pain to tell my story.	0
he leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .	0
i fight against thee ?	0
i beg you ,  continue .	0
my most dear lord!	0
signior leonato ,  listen to the friar’s plan .	0
enough ,  i am engaged .	0
you have always been the father of good news.	0
let him come, and now tell caesar what it is that he wants.	0
what is here ?	0
go then ,  find me a meet hour to draw don pedro and the count claudio alone .	0
art thou not, fatal vision, sensible to feeling as to sight?	0
easy ,  petruchio .	0
none ,  but your beauty .	0
indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold him— dead — is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd .	0
you’re in your own kingdom ,  sir .	0
you counterfeit ,  you puppet you !	0
o, that you bore the mind that i do!	0
i’ll tell you privately .	0
i have said .	0
you know that you are brutus that speaks this, or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	0
the sooner ,  sweet ,  for you .	0
i don’t know .	0
but aren’t some well that we must make sick?	0
do you hear, cassio?	0
what form?	0
my honour'd lord, you know right well you did, and with them words of so sweet breath compos'd as made the things more rich.	0
either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him ,  as it does this good king’s blood .	0
you must not put another scandal on him ,  that he is open to inconstancy .	0
thou art a fellow of a good respect; thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it .	0
had all his hairs been lives my great revenge had stomach for them all .	0
ok ,  that’s fine .	0
there's fennel for you ,  and columbines .	0
o the heavens !	0
if thou keep promise ,  i shall end this strife; become a christian ,  and thy loving wife .	0
i’d risk my soul for that .	0
he ,  woman; i say your husband .	0
perchance till after theseus' wedding-day.	0
who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down ?	0
well ,  it’s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .	0
speak .	0
hey ,  hurry up ,  hurry up !	0
read the will !	0
boy !	0
to leave his wife ,  to leave his babes ,  his mansion ,  and his titles ,  in a place that he himself flies from ?	0
come ,  death ,  and welcome !	0
but how long will  “ ever ”  last ?	0
here .	0
i think she will be ruled by me in all respects, no more, i don’t doubt it.	0
one of them contains my picture, prince; if you choose that, then i am yours as well.	0
lives ,  sir .	0
nor i. i would not live there, to put my father into violent thoughts, by being always in his sight.	0
come ,  sisters ,  cheer we up his sprites ,  and show the best of our delights .	0
i see these lords so much admire at this meeting that they eat their own common sense ,  and scarcely think their eyes tell them the truth .	0
i would i were ,  to be revenged on thee .	0
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it; and yet i would it were to give again .	0
do you think you’ve got a couple of fools on your hands here ?	0
he is not the flower of courtesy ,  but ,  i'll warrant him ,  as gentle as a lamb .	0
my lord ,  i came to see your father's funeral .	0
about the table ,  sir ,  dinner will be served on it .	0
now die ,  die ,  die ,  die ,  die .	0
good bawcock ,  'bate thy rage .	0
four legs and two voices—a very special monster .	0
if there were two men like you ,  pretty soon there’d be none because the two of you would kill each other .	0
nay ,  good my lord— it is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain - giving as would perhaps trouble a woman .	0
this is pure insanity .	0
i would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died.	0
i do not know that you are as good a man as myself .	0
methought i had ,  and often did i strive to yield the ghost ,  but still the envious flood stopped in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty ,  vast ,  and wand'ring air ,  but smothered it within my panting bulk ,  who almost burst to belch it in the sea .	0
come to me again ,  and bring me word what he doth say to thee .	0
the same indeed; a very valiant fellow .	0
is this the nature that passion could not shake ?	0
o cursed spite ,  that ever i was born to set it right !	0
wherefore ?	0
what ,  shall one of us that struck the foremost man of all this world but for supporting robbers ,  shall we now contaminate our fingers with base bribes ,  and sell the mighty space of our large honors for so much trash as may be graspèd thus ?	0
who knows if donalbain be with his brother ?	0
nay ,  rather persuade him to hold his hands .	0
good news ,  friends .	0
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar .	0
you would run away from a bear ,  but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean ,  you’d turn around and confront the bear .	0
but we are prevented .	0
ay ,  every inch a king .	0
our master and mistress seeks you .	0
it much would please him that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon .	0
yes ,  exactly .	0
inside the bond of marriage, tell me, brutus, is my knowing secrets that appertain to you an exception to our vows?	0
good day.—please tell me, sir, can you read?	0
the king will be angry with him .	0
if she be false ,  heaven mocked itself .	0
stand, ho!	0
if you care about your health ,  you won’t push me any further .	0
when and where and how we met ,  we wooed and made exchange of vow ,  i’ll tell thee as we pass ,  but this i pray: that thou consent to marry us today .	0
what's here ?	0
i must attend mine office ,  or would have done ’t myself .	0
do you know me ,  my lord ?	0
come ,  wait upon him; lead him to my bower .	0
an if thou couldst ,  thou couldst not make him live .	0
no, that's certain.	0
the question of his death is recorded on rolls in the capitol ,  his glory not made thin ,  where he was worthy; nor are his offenses recorded ,  for which he suffered death .	0
i never heard so musical a noise ,  such sweet thunder .	0
he has ridden his prologue like a rough colt.	0
sir, a whole history.	0
you have some plea for caesar ,  don’t you ?	0
my songbird ,  we have beaten them to their beds .	0
you must tell his name and half his face must be seen through the lion's neck ,  and he himself must speak through the mask saying this ,  or something to the same defect , — " ladies ,  "  or  " fair ladies ,  i would wish you ,  or ,  i would request you ,  or ,  i would entreat you ,  not to be afraid ,  not to tremble .	0
o ,  no !	0
he hath not touched you yet .	0
but stay;—oh spite !	0
i’ll frown at them as they pass by ,  and they can react however they want .	0
that is a mistake.	0
to hell with all worn - out horses ,  all crazy masters ,  and all bad roads .	0
the king is full of grace and fair regard .	0
her worth being mounted on the wind ,  through all the world bears rosalind .	0
they were villains, murderers.	0
neither, my lord.	0
of course i hear it .	0
an abominable monster !	0
oh ,  thou wilt speak again of banishment .	0
cheer up ,  because i think you’re going to hell .	0
what’s wrong with me, that every noise makes me jump?	0
will you hear ’t again ?	0
now ,  if courtiers were shepherds ,  that kind of courtesy would be unclean .	0
murder, murder!	0
drown'd ,  drown'd .	0
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if 'were cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!	0
how came we ashore ?	0
rebels it at these years?	0
let but the commons hear this testament— which ,  pardon me ,  i do not mean to read— and they would go and kiss dead caesar's wounds and dip their napkins in his sacred blood ,  yea ,  beg a hair of him for memory ,  and ,  dying ,  mention it within their wills ,  bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto their issue .	0
have you got permission to go to confession today?	0
a proper saying !	0
romeo .	0
what man is that?	0
the queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?	0
but everything that lives is mortal ,  including the foolishness of love .	0
an ugly disease afflicts the new flowers of the spring too often before they have bloomed, and in the morning and liquid dew of youth contagious shriveling is the most imminent.	0
there are no tricks in plain and simple faith; but hollow men ,  like horses hot at hand ,  make gallant show and promise of their mettle; but when they should endure the bloody spur ,  they fall their crests and like deceitful jades sink in the trial .	0
help ,  ho !	0
dear gods in heaven ,  what’s the reason for this ?	0
i do not think so .	0
i do beg you, give him permission to go.	0
pluck them asunder.	0
huh?	0
it doesn’t need to be witty as long as it’s eloquent and imaginative .	0
let her have your votes .	0
and why ,  sir ,  must they so ?	0
the lover, just as crazy, sees helen of troy's beauty in an egyptian.	0
where is the horse that retraces his boring steps again with the same fire that he walked them in the first place?	0
but my muse labors ,  and thus she is deliver'd .	0
so is the dear'st o'th’ loss.	0
my ships come home a month before the day .	0
be as your thoughts teach you; whatever you are ,  i am obedient .	0
now that i think about it ,  i really want it .	0
stones have been known to move and trees to speak; augures and understood relations have by maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth the secret'st man of blood .	0
i fear i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabb'd caesar; i do fear it.	0
farewell ,  farewell !	0
did michael cassio ,  when you woo'd my lady ,  know of your love ?	0
not in the legions of horrid hell can come a devil more damned in evils to top macbeth .	0
nothing else ,  for god’s sake !	0
sir ,  have pity; i'll be his surety .	0
now ,  my dearest queen— please ,  stand farther away from me .	0
oh ,  monstrous !	0
the worse that you give me the additional information whose lack of information even kills me .	0
still the same old cassius !	0
your servants always have their necessities ,  themselves ,  and what they own ,  in elegance ,  to make their reckoning of accounts at your highness' pleasure ,  still to return your own goods .	0
is this true ?	0
he can report ,  as seemeth by his plight ,  of the revolt the newest state .	0
god bless you, sir!	0
to tell you that you’ll see me at philippi .	0
my will, not all the world!	0
will it ?	0
it is bad weather in us all, good sir, when you are cloudy.	0
sir ,  i’m half - blind .	0
i myself am the king of naples ,  since i saw with my own eyes—these eyes that haven’t been dry since—my father killed in a shipwreck .	0
but that i love you best ,  o most best ,  believe it .	0
ay ,  and said nothing but what i protest intendment of doing .	0
death’s the end of all .	0
why ,  anything; an honorable murderer ,  if you will; because nothing i did was in hate ,  but done all in honor .	0
but it’d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .	0
i did send ,  after the last enchantment you did here ,  a ring in chase of you .	0
he’s as good at anything and yet a fool .	0
tell me ,  good my friend ,  what torch is yond that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?	0
i’m learning every hour how to be subservient .	0
by gis and by saint charity ,  alack ,  and fie for shame !	0
release me so i can return to my dukedom with your help .	0
now i’ll ask cassio about bianca ,  a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .	0
come ,  sisters ,  let’s cheer him up ,  and show him the best of our delights .	0
did this companion with the saffron face revel and feast it at my house today whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house ?	0
o heavens !	0
o lord !	0
i will read it .	0
why, what care i?	0
that’s the truth .	0
there are still some few odd lads missing from your company that you forget .	0
no more!	0
i am very reluctant to go; there is some ill disturbing my rest, because i dreamt of moneybags tonight.	0
we fail?	0
i frown upon him, yet he loves me still.	0
thus do i ever make my fool my purse .	0
most constantly.	0
o ,  in this kind of love ,  you love your child so badly that you are going crazy ,  seeing that she is well .	0
whip me, you devils, from the possession of this heavenly sight!	0
love-news, in faith.	0
no way but this ,  killing myself ,  to die upon a kiss .	0
go in; and tell my lady i am gone, having displeas'd my father, to laurence’ cell, to make confession and to be absolv'd.	0
my fool usurps my body .	0
that’s what’s clever about it .	0
paddock calls .	0
may she give that ?	0
thou liest.	0
should i have answer'd caius cassius so ?	0
i want to drink your health .	0
the duke cannot deny the course of law, for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice; if it be denied, 'twill much impeach the justice of the state; since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations.	0
prithee, peace!	0
i partly guess ,  for i have loved ere now .	0
ay, if i know the letters and the language.	0
oh ,  i’d kill that bastard cassio forty thousand times if i could !	0
where is the horse that doth untread again, his tedious measures with the unbated fire, that he did pace them first?	0
she's not fourteen .	0
he killed your relative ,  brave mercutio ,  and then young romeo killed him .	0
doesn’t it look like the king?	0
young romeo ,  is it ?	0
but he, that hath the steerage of my course, direct my sail!	0
and even the like precurse of feared events ,  as harbingers preceding still the fates and prologue to the omen coming on ,  have heaven and earth together demonstrated unto our climature and countrymen .	0
let me report to him your sweet dependency ,  and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness where he for grace is kneeled to .	0
what right did he have to scold me like that ?	0
and, gentle puck, take this donkey head off the head of this athenian lover, that when he wakes when the others do, all of them may go back to athens, thinking no more about tonight’s events than that they were parts of a dream.	0
what do you say ,  james soundpost ?	0
your scolding is somewhat overblown .	0
i have said it .	0
there is so much money if you’ll kill me now; kill brutus, and be honored in his death.	0
if they do this ,  as they will ,  god willing ,  my ransom will soon be raised .	0
i might come back soon .	0
i’d better not drink now .	0
i have slept ,  my lord ,  already .	0
in youth when i did love ,  did love ,  i thought it was very sweet ,  to contract ,  o ,  the time for ,  ah ,  my reason ,  o ,  i thought there was nothing meet .	0
my good lord ,  be quiet .	0
nor our strong sorrow [aside to donalbain.	0
keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .	0
you, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear the smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor, may now, perchance, both quake and tremble here, when lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.	0
is this the fine of his fines ,  and the recovery of his recoveries ,  to have his fine pate full of fine dirt ?	0
it isn’t healthy to expose your weak condition to the raw - cold morning like this .	0
he is all the mother’s ,  from the top to toe .	0
peter, stay at the gate.	0
his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury .	0
who doesn’t know that the good duke is dead ?	0
why ,  friends ,  you don’t even know what you’re doing yet .	0
what’s going on ?	0
was he a gentleman ?	0
sure ,  or anything else you show him .	0
if i should be ?	0
he won’t have a chance .	0
if she sends any letters to richmond ,  you will be accountable to me for it .	0
charmian ,  hark .	0
for this slave ,  if there be any cunning cruelty that can torment him much and hold him long ,  it shall be his .	0
why dost thou ask?	0
honest ,  my lord ?	0
well - a - day that you were ,  sir .	0
sure ones ,  then .	0
why ,  how now ?	0
come, one for me.	0
she wakes .	0
yes ,  sir .	0
gentlemen!	0
i'll to my truckle - bed; this field - bed is too cold for me to sleep .	0
there are the players .	0
with the help of the grim  the first to greet me there was my great	0
my father's spirit in arms!	0
be you constant in the accusation ,  and my cunning shall not shame me .	0
you won’t regret this .	0
or so much as it needs to dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.	0
my royal lord ,  you do not give the cheer .	0
belike this is a man of that quirk .	0
they cannot budge till your release .	0
now ,  on my life ,  the young child must be headed to the tower to greet the young princes ,  whom she adores .	0
brutus, bait not me, i'll not endure it.	0
good master fabian ,  grant me another request .	0
what’s your pleasure ,  sir ?	0
thus have i, wall, my part discharged so; and, being done, thus wall away doth go.	0
no boasting like a fool .	0
what's that ,  my lord ?	0
and let these deceitful fiends be believed no more, that trick us with double meanings, that keep the word of promise to our ears, and break it to our hopes!	0
what, look'd he frowningly?	0
fare you well ,  my lord .	0
good luck ,  worthy soldier ,  and good - bye .	0
what, gertrude?	0
go get it ready .	0
still did i tell him it was vile and bad .	0
my lord ,  that would dishonour him .	0
she has the patience of a  i’ll see you hanged on sunday first !	0
i will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways .	0
this bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	0
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear— beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!	0
then leave him out .	0
if thou hast her not i' the end ,  call me  “ cut .  ”   if i do not ,  never trust me ,  take it how you will .	0
two or three men ,  my lord ,  who brought the message that macduff has fled to england .	0
who can impress the forest ,  bid the tree unfix his earthbound root ?	0
freely tell her the truth; beg her help to put you in your place again .	0
sir, most heedfully.	0
speak ,  man ,  what’s the matter ?	0
oh ,  here it is .	0
if i do prove her haggard, though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, i'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind to prey at fortune.	0
what bastard doesn’t ?	0
show .	0
tybalt ,  that murderer ,  which way ran he ?	0
why are your swords out ?	0
in law ,  what plea so tainted and corrupt ,  but ,  being season'd with a gracious voice ,  obscures the show of evil ?	0
out, damned spot!	0
good morrow to you both .	0
there on the ground, made drunk with his own tears.	0
how the man jowls it to the ground, as if it were cain's jawbone, that did the first murder!	0
when remedies are past ,  the griefs are ended by seeing the worst ,  which late on hopes depended .	0
no ,  none that thou hast wit enough to make .	0
but do you really think the prince would treat you that way ?	0
someone adored me once ,  too .	0
because ,  if you must know ,  she’s been chosen by signior gremio .	0
dear maid ,  kind sister ,  sweet ophelia !	0
tis strange .	0
o calm ,  dishonorable ,  vile submission !	0
pray you, sit still.	0
there was no end to his generosity .	0
if you were civil and had any manners, you wouldn’t insult me so much like this.	0
how oddly he is suited !	0
accursed ,  unhappy ,  wretched ,  hateful day !	0
if you can shape up ,  you’re welcome to stay in the house .	0
i will not till i please .	0
be not you ashamed to show ,  he’ll not shame to tell you what it means .	0
this the dauphin speaks .	0
what ?	0
murder!	0
o ,  forgive me my sins !	0
welcome ,  good friends .	0
a trade ,  sir ,  that i hope i may use with a safe conscience ,  which is ,  indeed ,  sir ,  a mender of bad soles .	0
i will answer you with gait and entrance .	0
you got me ,  i admit it .	0
you won’t make a liar out of me.	0
i knew temperance—she was a fine girl .	0
if i can catch him once upon the hip ,  i will feed fat the ancient grudge i bear him .	0
i see you all are bent to set against me for your entertainment .	0
i anger her sometimes ,  and tell her that paris is the properer man; but i'll warrant you ,  when i say so ,  she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .	0
yes ,  i swear .	0
you should pity rather than despise this situation.	0
then all alone at the prearranged hour of her waking up ,  i came to take her from her relative's tomb ,  intending to keep her close at my cell until i could easily send for romeo .	0
how is it else the  “ man i' th' moon ”  ?	0
meanwhile ,  thank you for your efforts .	0
come ,  let’s do so .	0
mustardseed .	0
this lanthorn doth the horned moon present; myself the man i' the moon do seem to be .	0
shall we be sundered ?	0
your noble shape is only a form of wax, deviating from the valor of a man; your dear love sworn is empty lies, killing that love which you have vowed to cherish; your wit, that ornament to shape and love, disfigured in the conduct of them both, like powder in a recruit soldier's flask, is set a-fire by your own ignorance, and you dismembered by your own defense.	0
i don’t have evil in me sometimes to do me service.	0
what ,  thou ?	0
even so .	0
away, you ethiope!	0
we have been praying for our husbands' welfare, which are moving along quickly, we hope, the better for our words.	0
andrew aguecheek ”	0
follow me .	0
what need we fear who knows it ,  when none can call our power to account ?	0
we are yet but young in deed.	0
what do you think of marching to philippi now?	0
we will ,  we will !	0
ah ,  dear ,  if i be so ,  from my cold heart let heaven engender hail ,  and poison it in the source ,  and the first stone drop in my neck .	0
if there be any impediment ,  i pray you discover it .	0
how now!	0
his shroud is as white as the mountain snow, alas, look here, my lord!	0
come, thou gentle day.	0
how am i evil to advise cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good ?	0
god made him ,  and therefore let him pass for a man .	0
how do you mean removing of him ?	0
i’ll pheeze you ,  in faith .	0
i’ll make a sop o' th' moonshine of you .	0
i know him now .	0
i will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .	0
well then ,  margaret ,  ursula ,  and my cousin have been very much deceived ,  for they swore you did .	0
in a town of war still waging ,  the people's hearts brimful of fear ,  to control private and domestic quarrels ,  at night ,  and on the court and guard of safety !	0
since you give me so much trouble ,  let me remind you what you have promised ,  which is not yet done for me .	0
where is your son?	0
now, until the break of day, through this house each fairy stray.	0
listen, romeo, listen!	0
think not ,  thou noble roman ,  that ever brutus will go bound to rome .	0
put up your sword .	0
tell us where it is ,  that we may take it from there ,  and carry it to the chapel .	0
the general cause?	0
the lunatic ,  the lover ,  and the poet ,  are of imagination all compact .	0
i dare ,  my lord ,  to bet that she is honest ,  burn me at the stake .	0
when they next wake, all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision; and back to athens shall the lovers wend, with league whose date till death shall never end.	0
her curses have made my hair stand on end .	0
it was just two days ago that i tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .	0
indeed they say that the senators mean to establish caesar as a king tomorrow , and that he will be king everywhere ,  in every place ,  except here in italy .	0
where are the noble hastings ,  rivers ,  vaughan ,  grey ?	0
lucius ,  awake .	0
brother john bates ,  isn’t that dawn breaking over there ?	0
thou art not conquered .	0
take it off and throw it away .	0
did you see master lorenzo ?	0
is not this well ?	0
may i have a word with you?	0
how now ,  sweet queen ?	0
who gave you the directions to this place ?	0
i have lived long enough .	0
hear me with patience .	0
what claim lays she to thee ?	0
where should i have lost that handkerchief, emilia?	0
dost thou hear me, old friend?	0
it is almost morning ,  and yet ,  i am sure ,  you are not satisfied of these events at full .	0

did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?	0
ride you this afternoon ?	0

did this in caesar seem ambitious ?	0
twere best he speak no harm of brutus here .	0
leonato and his brother .	0
what noise is that?	0
it’s a good thing i’m like a little pot and warm up quickly ,  or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth ,  my tongue to the roof of my mouth ,  and my heart would freeze in my belly ,  before i managed to get thawed out .	0
oh ,  lord ,  if they were married ,  they’d drive themselves crazy within a week .	0
bliss be upon you !	0
if we have sweet - smelling breath ,  i’m sure they’ll say  “ it’s a sweet play .  ”  now no more talking .	0
what i should deny— as this i would ,  ay ,  though thou didst produce my very character—i’d turn it all to thy suggestion ,  plot ,  and damnèd practice .	0
o lamentable day!	0
i remember the first time ever caesar put it on; 'twas on a summer's evening, in his tent, that day he overcame the nervii.	0
have i lost my wit ?	0
why did he do it ?	0
thou hast most kindly hit it .	0
to't.	0
i’ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .	0
this man is pyramus, if you want to know; this beauteous lady is certainly thisbe.	0

richmond is on the seas .	0
what is the news?	0
how now, my love!	0
you see ,  her eyes are open .	0
i know that some danger approaches you nearby .	0
no more than that ,  my lord .	0
why ,  sir ,  he’s not coming .	0
boy ,  this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw .	0
what soldiers, milk-face?	0
your spirits wildly peep from your eyes ,  and ,  as the sleeping soldiers at the alarm ,  your bedded hairs ,  like life in growths ,  start up and stand an end .	0
o, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.	0

he’s married to octavia ,  madam .	0
here, catch this chest; it is worth the trouble.	0
ay ,  my good lord .	0
ay, but the clerk that never means to do it, unless he live until he be a man.	0
you should have reprimanded him for that .	0

who is't that can inform me ?	0
i’ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now ,  if it’s okay that i’m picking up what others have thrown away .	0
the things i’m saying are fair and honest .	0
i thank thee .	0
men at some time are masters of their fates .	0
i’ll also wear this in my cap .	0
no ,  cassius ,  no .	0
you have a beautiful half - sister ,  octavia .	0
don’t swear by the future ,  because you’ve ruined it before it has even arrived .	0
damn those men shouting down there !	0
you said the enemy would not come down, but keep the hills and upper regions.	0
the grief that does not speak whispers the o'er fraught heart ,  and bids it break .	0
my dear - loved cousin ,  and my dearer lord ?	0
what shall i do?	0

then she is well ,  and nothing can be ill .	0
good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do, in such disdainful manner me to woo.	0

this one talks about how roderigo should kill cassio .	0
how goes the world ,  sir ,  now ?	0
that’ll be fine .	0
o, by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo!	0
such news ,  my lord ,  as grieves me to report .	0
there’s something in ’t that is deceivable .	0
i'll be your foil ,  laertes .	0
yes ,  ma'am .	0
i know he wouldn’t be a wolf if the romans didn’t act like sheep .	0
i will be hang'd, if some eternal villain, some busy and insinuating rogue, some cogging cozening slave, to get some office, have not devised this slander; i'll be hang'd else.	0
but my hair looks good anyway ,  doesn’t it ?	0
ross: what sights ,  my lord ?	0

our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail ,  as formidable as the sea itself .	0
these griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.	0

yes ,  that’s the one .	0
o thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?	0
it is not moonlight now .	0
no, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve.	0
not yet.	0
i will not fail !	0
won’t you tell me who told you that ?	0
may one be forgiven a sin and still hold on to its benefits ?	0
and to make it even clearer ,  we can tell them that i’m playing pyramus but i’m not really pyramus—really ,  i’m bottom the weaver .	0
that’s our offer .	0
by mary ,  have patience; or i shall say you are totally in a temper ,  and not a man .	0
come ,  we'll to sleep .	0
i am an ass ,  i am a woman’s man ,  and besides myself .	0
who’s calling me ?	0
it well appears.	0
be tough ,  ”  says the devil ,   “ and run !  ”  but then my conscience ,  hanging around my heart ,  says very wisely to me ,   “ my good friend launcelot ,  you’re a good boy ,  the son of an honest man ,  ”  really ,  that should be the son of an honest woman ,  since my father cheated on my mother .	0
if you’re so fond of her sin ,  give her permission to offend; because ,  if it doesn’t affect you ,  it affects nobody .	0
ay ,  what else ?	0
come now, keep your oath; now be a freeman, and, search this chest with this good sword, that ran through caesar's bowels.	0
when he regained consciousness again ,  he said that if he’d done or said anything wrong ,  he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness .	0
now i am alone .	0
when we’re in love ,  we don’t see with our eyes but with our minds .	0
examples gross as earth exhort me.	0
hurry up ,  hurry up .	0
hold ,  take my sword .	0
and i’ll use my methods so well, that they shall go far with little effort.	0
nay ,  good ,  be patient .	0
i’ve heard too much already, because your words and actions don’t agree with each other.	0
at seventeen years ,  many their fortunes seek ,  but at fourscore ,  it is too late a week .	0
hello !	0
lay out the gown .	0
one more thing ,  good gentlemen .	0
that fair - skinned ,  hard - hearted hussy ,  rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .	0
what is pyramus?	0
are you not a strumpet ?	0
how canst thou thus for shame ,  titania ,  knowing i know thy love to theseus ?	0
come hither ,  herald . —let the trumpet sound , — and read out this .	0
to what end ,  my lord ?	0
on the sixth hour; at which time ,  my lord ,  you said our work should cease .	0
i am ready now.	0
be merciful ,  say ‘death’; for exile hath more terror in his look ,  much more than death .	0
i remember one said there were no sal -  lets in the lines to make the matter savoury ,  nor no mat -  ter in the phrase that might indict the author of affecta -  tion; but called it an honest method ,  as wholesome as sweet ,  and by very much more handsome than fine .	0
well ,  let it strike .	0
the cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .	0
o knight ,  thou lackest a cup of canary .	0
we came here to fight against you .	0
mustardseed .	0
go find out the news .	0
farewell.	0
do you triumph ?	0
what are you ?	0
knock ,  i say .	0
i think that, since she must die once, i have the patience to endure it now.	0
why ,  she defies me like turk to christian .	0
his absence means he’s broken his promise ,  sir .	0
for who would bear the whips and scorns of time ,  th' oppressor’s wrong ,  the proud man’s contumely ,  the pangs of despised love ,  the law’s delay ,  the insolence of office ,  and the spurns that patient merit of th' unworthy takes ,  when he himself might his quietus make with a bare bodkin ?	0
we don’t intend any harm to you ,  nor to anyone else .	0
why, i will fight with him upon this theme until my eyelids will no longer wag.	0
so long ?	0
eventually ,  as patient as the female dove when that her golden twins are discovered ,  his silence will sit drooping .	0
o ,  what a rash and bloody deed is this !	0
think so, iago?	0
you shall not go ,  my lord .	0
you will see me no more ,  whether he be dead or not .	0
no ,  monster ,  not i .	0
nay 'tis twice two months ,  my lord .	0
wait until i read the letter .	0
farewell ,  hostess .	0
until then ,  we’ve said enough .	0
which way?	0
his son is older, sir; his son is thirty.	0
tis partly my own fault ,  which death or absence soon shall remedy .	0
and so fare thee well .	0
you, mistress, that have the office opposite to saint peter, and keep the gate of hell!	0
brutus is wise, and, were he not in health, he would embrace the means to come by it.	0
these our actors ,  as i told you before ,  were all spirits and have melted into air ,  into thin air: and ,  like the invisible fabric of this vision ,  the cloud - capped towers ,  the gorgeous palaces ,  the solemn temples ,  the great world itself ,  yes ,  all who inherit it ,  shall dissolve and leave not even a clue behind ,  as this pageant of no substance faded .	0
if he isn’t what he might be ,  then i wish to god he were !	0
i swear ,  i think my wife’s faithful ,  and i think she’s not .	0
armed ,  my lord .	0
welcome to elsinore .	0
o ,  how my heart abhors to hear him nam'd and cannot come to him ,  to wreak the love i bore my cousin tybalt upon his body that hath slaughter'd him !	0
go with me to a notary ,  seal me there your single bond ,  and—in a merry sport— if you repay me not on such a day ,  in such a place ,  such sum or sums as are expressed in the condition ,  let the forfeit be nominated for an equal pound of your fair flesh ,  to be cut off and taken in what part of your body pleaseth me .	0
you haven’t forgotten the half of a kingdom i gave you .	0
he ran this way ,  and leaped over this orchard wall .	0
but then he said strange things to me .	0
if you want to make me happy ,  don’t wish yourself harm .	0
you shall have leave.	0
hey !	0
but could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?	0
i can’t put my feelings into verse ,  but please believe i love you best ,  oh ,  best of all .	0
if thou couldst, doctor, cast the water of my land, find her disease and purge it to a sound and pristine health, i would applaud thee to the very echo, that should applaud again.	0
quiet !	0
you’ve lost your resolve .	0
you look like a person who knows the business of war .	0
no ,  wench !	0
he says, for brutus' sake, he finds himself beholding to us all.	0
i can hit quickly ,  if i’m motivated .	0
there’s justice in heaven after all !	0
and for three months.	0
if you did wed my sister for her wealth ,  then for her wealth’s sake use her with more kindness .	0
what was your dream ?	0
why ,  love ,  i say !	0
no .	0
and good ones ,  too .	0
have patience ,  madam .	0
sweet now ,  silence !	0
slaying is the word; it is a deed that’s in style.	0
i will look on it.	0
can you help me ?	0
who’s calling me ?	0
the biggest clue is his seriousness .	0
there wasn’t a soul that only felt a fever of the madness and played some tricks out of desperation.	0
they finished their business with pompey ,  and pompey has left .	0
hurry up .	0
ay ,  if i know the letters and the language .	0
anon ,  good nurse !	0
treat me like you would treat a dog—kick me ,  hit me ,  neglect me ,  try to lose me .	0
it’d be impossible for you to watch them ,  even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks .	0
o ,  teach me how i should forget to think .	0
eyes ,  do you see ?	0
what ,  in our own house ?	0
damn it ,  god forbid !	0
why do you look so pale ?	0
and what’s her story ?	0
speak !	0
then ,  window ,  let day in ,  and let life out .	0
if you will not murder me for my love ,  let me be your servant .	0
i’ll torture him .	0
if he break the peace ,  he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .	0
tomorrow we'll speak among ourselves, again.	0
no, don’t let me.	0
i never saw my father in my life .	0
hold, for your lives!	0
did he receive you well?	0
here lies hero ,  the heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .	0
and when does he leave ?	0
well ,  go to .	0
are your tears wet ?	0
really ,  my lord ,  i would not .	0
and so ,  with no money at all and a little more wit ,  return again to venice .	0
you and your meaner fellows performed your last jobs very well ,  and i must use you in another similar trick .	0
our queen and all her elves come here anon .	0
there shall i try ,  in my oration ,  how the people take the cruel issue of these bloody men ,  according to the which thou shalt discourse to young octavius of the state of things .	0
don’t i have reason, hags that you are, impudent and overbold?	0
i pray you, good bassanio, let me know it; and, if it stand, as you yourself still do, within the eye of honour, be assur'd, my purse, my person, my extremest means, lie all unlock'd to your occasions.	0
i think there is a lot of reason in what he’s saying.	0
how do you, pretty lady?	0
what is the matter here?	0
i knew it would be your answer .	0
call my guard ,  please .	0
it would be better if you actually applied it to your life .	0
i have forgot your name ,  but sure that part was aptly fitted and naturally performed .	0
tell me what my part is ,  and then proceed .	0
roderigo !	0
what trash is rome ,  what rubbish and what offal ,  when it serves for the base matter to illuminate so vile a thing as caesar ?	0
i remember the first time caesar ever put it on; it was on a summer's evening, in his tent, that day he overcame belgium.	0
marry, a perfumed one.	0
speak !	0
am i that name ,  iago ?	0
i  “ an itching palm ”  !	0
marry, farewell!	0
should i blab to her that you’re coming ?	0
o my dear gertrude, this worry, compared to a murdering piece, gives me more than enough death in many places.	0
a messenger has arrived from caesar .	0
i never gave him token.	0
thank you .	0
thou may ’st revenge —o slave !	0
what’s this song ?	0
i’m a gentleman .	0
i am yet unknown to woman, never was forsworn, scarcely have coveted what was mine own, at no time broke my faith, would not betray the devil to his fellow, and delight no less in truth than life.	0
i am glad to see thee well .	0
yet tell me not ,  for i have heard it all .	0
romeo, doff thy name; and for that name, which is no part of thee, take all myself.	0
if the jew her father ever comes to heaven, it will be for his gentle daughter's sake; and never should misfortune dare to cross her foot, unless she does it under this excuse, that she is daughter to a faithless jew.	0
inform her full of my particular fear ,  and thereto add such reasons of your own as may compact it more .	0
i think that our father will leave here tonight .	0
o ,  forgive me my sins !	0
are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?	0
i am no pilot; yet ,  wert thou as far as that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea ,  i would adventure for such merchandise .	0
i might call him a divine thing; because i have never seen anything so natural that was so noble.	0
go wisely and slowly .	0
good - bye for a while .	0
arm'd ,  my lord .	0
we must bear all .	0
do you not jest ?	0
just as you mention it in the charge.	0
follow me ,  then ,  to plainer ground .	0
romeo, there dead, was husband to that juliet; and she, there dead, that romeo's faithful wife.	0
take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude ,  not as a fee .	0
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses .	0
you that choose not by looks, gamble as fair and choose as true!	0
get you gone ,  you dwarf; you minimus ,  of hind'ring knot - grass made; you bead ,  you acorn .	0
wouldn’t it make one weep?	0
silenced with that, in viewing o'er the rest o’ the selfsame day, he finds thee in the stout norweyan ranks, nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, strange images of death.	0
you say right, sir.	0
they in themselves, to tell the truth, are as light as a flute.	0
as whence the sun ’gins his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come discomfort swells.	0
he’s going after a young widow .	0
no ,  messala .	0
have them click their heels together and don’t dare touch a hair of the master’s horse’s tail till they kiss their hands .	0
down with the capulets !	0
mistress ,  both man and master is possessed .	0
my ever gentle cousin ,  welcome hither .	0
ay me !	0
seek it out.	0
favors ?	0
here’s neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all .	0
then he swore he was a stranger here .	0
i am dying ,  cleopatra ,  dying .	0
and squabble?	0
i’ll fix you ,  i swear .	0
it is the right butter - women’s rank to market .	0
have you your father's leave ?	0
ere i would say i would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen, i would change my humanity with a baboon.	0
yes ,  ma'am ,  we have .	0
conscience and grace, to the deepest pit!	0
what villain, madam?	0
please forgive me as i forgive you ,  hamlet .	0
varro!	0
how now ,  my lord !	0
he dined at my house; but i don’t shake because of that.	0
you may have very fit occasion for ’t .	0
thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end !	0
i do spy a kind of hope, which craves as desperate an execution as that is desperate which we would prevent.	0
nor for yours neither .	0
then please ,  put off your eating for a little while i ,  like a mother doe ,  find my fawn and bring it food .	0
stones have been known to move, and trees to speak.	0
how stand i then, that have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd, excitements of my reason and my blood, and let all sleep, while to my shame i see the imminent death of twenty thousand men that for a fantasy and trick of fame go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, which is not tomb enough and continent to hide the slain?	0
when?	0
consider then that we come but in scorn.	0
be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd; here is my journey's end, here is my butt and very seamark of my utmost sail.	0
a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!	0
i give him curses ,  yet he gives me love .	0
yes ,  that’s the way i’ll do it .	0
ah ,  what an unlucky hour is guilty of this lamentable event !	0
a right fair mark ,  fair coz ,  is the first hit .	0
i think it’s better to call it off .	0
listen, but don’t speak to it.	0
nay ,  if our wits run the wild - goose chase ,  i am done; for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than ,  i am sure ,  i have in my whole five .	0
ah me!	0
yes ,  she did tell us .	0
as for your intentions to go back to school in wittenberg, leaving here is not something that we want, and we beg you to give into remaining here in the happiness and pleasure of our eyes, our most important courtier, cousin, and our son.	0
o proud death ,  what feast is toward in thine eternal cell that thou so many princes at a shot so bloodily hast struck ?	0
i feel tortured by all this talking .	0
it must needs be of subtle, tender, and delicate temperance.	0
isn’t that him on the ground ?	0
you mean i should groan and tell you ?	0
well ,  in that hit you miss .	0
coragio ,  bully -  monster ,  coragio !	0
i explained how you were deceived ,  how you were thwarted ,  the things that were used against you ,  who was working against you ,  and a lot of other things that would convince even a half - wit or a crazy person to say ,   “ banquo did it !  ”  you explained it all .	0
i am glad to see your highness .	0
you are three men of sin, whom destiny, that hath to instrument this lower world and what is in't, the never-surfeited sea hath caused to belch up you, and on this island where man doth not inhabit, you ’mongst men being most unfit to live.	0
they show their bloody heralds of battle ,  and something must be done immediately .	0
i shook your hands for that reason; but i was really distracted from the point by looking down on caesar.	0
now do i see ’tis true .	0
why ,  even so .	0
toad, that under cold stone days and nights has thirty-one swelter'd venom sleeping got, boil thou first i’ the charmed pot.	0
my salad days ,  when i was green in judgment ,  cold in blood ,  to say as i said then .	0
oh, hell!	0
so ,  come ,  help .	0
come ,  come ,  thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy; and as soon moved to be moody ,  and as soon moody to be moved .	0
oh ,  sir— don’t think i’m flattering you .	0
you notorious whore !	0
and what says my conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?	0
you ,  you ,  yes ,  you !	0
o, that the earth which kept the world in fear should patch a wall to expel the winter's cold!	0
none, man: all are idle whores and rogues.	0
i hope he be in love .	0
he doth nothing but frown; as who should say, an you will not have me, choose; he hears merry tales, and smiles not: i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old, being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth.	0
ay ,  or else someone must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern ,  and say he comes to imitate or to present the person of moonshine .	0
o stephano, two neapolitans escaped!	0
my mistress is in love with a monster.	0
your fortitude has left you alone.	0
dost thou love me ?	0
tell me where is fancy bred ,  in the heart or in the head ,  how begot ,  how nourished ?	0
well ,  sir ,  for want of other idleness ,  i’ll bide your proof .	0
she hath directed how i shall take her from her father's house; what gold and jewels she is furnish'd with; what page's suit she hath in readiness.	0
he shall kill two of us ,  and men indeed ,  but that’s no matter .	0
i loved ophelia!	0
give me the letter .	0
i know his eyes are worshiping some other woman ,  or why wouldn’t he be here ?	0
no ,  no ,  until it comes true we’ll pretend it was just a dream we had .	0
and then it seemed startled, like a guilty thing running from a court order.	0
i don’t believe it .	0
o cassius ,  brutus gave the word too early ,  who ,  having some advantage on octavius ,  took it too eagerly .	0
he’s hot - tempered ,  and he might try to hit you with his staff .	0
is this well done ?	0
beware macduff .	0
i have done .	0
and from thy hated presence part i so; see me no more, whether he be dead or no.	0
please put that log down and rest a while .	0
i find you passing gentle .	0
out upon it ,  old carrion !	0
you would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak.	0
very heathenish and very gross!	0
how old is she ?	0
and i am your rosalind .	0
in faith ,  i will .	0
and when she went away now ,   “ let this fellow be looked to .  ”   “ fellow !  ”  not  “ malvolio ,  ”  nor after my degree ,  but  “ fellow .  ”  why ,  everything adheres together ,  that no dram of a scruple ,  no scruple of a scruple ,  no obstacle ,  no incredulous or unsafe circumstance—what can be said ?	0
who are they following ?	0
truly ,  i think they are .	0
what will you give us ?	0
now i fear this will make it start all over again, therefore let's follow him.	0
he is about the house .	0
they have all stomachs .	0
my master ,  not myself ,  lacks recompense .	0
don’t go out today .	0
thou ,  my slave ,  as thou report’st thyself ,  wast then her servant .	0
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye ,  i can tell who should down .	0
o ,  what a beast was i to chide at him !	0
let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .	0
and now you claim you gave it to a judge’s clerk !	0
is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?	0
from henceforth i will ,  coz ,  and devise sports .	0
i’ve got no food to give you .	0
i’ve got her now ,  but i’ve got god to thank for it !	0
he's married.	0
and i, for disregarding your feud too, have lost a number of relatives.	0
you’ve got something for me ?	0
if i can’t have an estate by birthright ,  then i’ll get it by being clever .	0
look how she rubs her hands .	0
romeo is coming .	0
i believe it .	0
have you seen him today ?	0
nay ,  an thou canst not smile as the wind sits ,  thou'lt catch cold shortly .	0
who is it that cried !	0
come ,  what does romeo say ?	0
perchance, iago, i will ne'er go home.	0
god bless you, sir.	0
what ,  are you afraid ?	0
thou naughty knave ,  what trade ?	0
it likes us well; and at our more consider'd time we'll read, answer, and think upon this business.	0
i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter’s favor .	0
what’s that noise ?	0
never ,  my lord .	0
i call thee not .	0
the interim’s mine .	0
i found it in my chamber; and he himself confess'd but even now that there he dropp'd it for a special purpose which wrought to his desire .	0
stanley ,  look to your wife .	0
tis but a man gone .	0
the three of you have killed a sweet ,  innocent woman .	0
slaying is the word: it is a deed in fashion.	0
no .	0
do you hear me?	0
i hate him for he is a christian: but more ,  for that ,  in low simplicity ,  he lends out money gratis ,  and brings down the rate of usance here with us in venice .	0
goodbye ,  good launcelot .	0
say ,  uncle richard ,  if my brother comes ,  where will i stay till my coronation ?	0
lose nothing ?	0
generous madam ,  whatever shall become of michael cassio ,  he'll never be anything but your true servant .	0
with demetrius.	0
what !	0
no ,  sir .	0
it is so .	0
now, afore god, i am so vexed that every part about me quivers.	0
heaven and your thoughts are witnesses that you are .	0
i’m awkward in my speech and i’m not a smooth talker .	0
we wish your peace .	0
why should that name be sounded more than yours ?	0
i know the hand .	0
so did you me ,  my liege .	0
and when the cross blue lightning seemed to open the breast of heaven ,  i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it .	0
ah ,  my poor princes !	0
your speech is more refined than i would expect in such a remote place as this .	0
that’s what fulvia told me .	0
the same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.	0
his eyes are humbler than they used to be .	0
why ,  get you gone !	0
my heart is very light in my chest, and all this day an unusually happy spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.	0
what’s wrong with my niece ?	0
well, but to my choice: who chooseth me, shall get as much as he deserves.	0
you are thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the watch; therefore bear you the lantern .	0
the king doth keep his revels here tonight; take heed the queen come not within his sight; for oberon is passing fell and wrath ,  because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy ,  stolen from an indian king .	0
what if a rat troubles my house, and i am happy to give ten thousand dollars to have it captured?	0
let me comply with you in this garb ,  lest my extent to the players—which ,  i tell you ,  must show fairly outwards—should more appear like entertainment than yours .	0
why do we stop talking ,  that most may claim we did this ?	0
upon my knees, what doth your speech import?	0
if i had a plantation of this island ,  my lord , — listen ,  plant it with plants that sting .	0
could not this make thee know, the hate i bare thee made me leave thee so?	0
the king has killed his heart .	0
my lord ?	0
therefore ,  from your many years of experience in these matters ,  give me some advice now ,  or ,  look ,  between my will to go the limit and me ,  this bloody knife shall play the umpire ,  deciding the problem that your many years’ experience could bring to an honorable resolution .	0
o ,  what a fall was there ,  my countrymen !	0
oh ,  one child is one too many !	0
i will be deaf to pleading and excuses, nor shall tears or prayers buy your way out.	0
very well .	0
methinks you are my glass ,  and not my brother: i see by you i am a sweet - faced youth .	0
you’re a villain to say this about me .	0
i think withal there would be hands uplifted in my right; and here from gracious england have i offer of goodly thousands .	0
captain fluellen !	0
there is no world without verona walls ,  but purgatory ,  torture ,  hell itself .	0
write them together ,  yours is as fair a name; sound them ,  it doth become the mouth as well; weigh them ,  it is as heavy; conjure with 'em ,  brutus will start a spirit as soon as caesar .	0
i will none of your money .	0
hail to thee ,  thane of glamis !	0
lord hamlet— heaven secure him !	0
why should the poor be flattered ?	0
he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars ,  look you ,  of the roman disciplines ,  than is a puppy dog .	0
though science can explain them away ,  disasters still come after eclipses .	0
farewell, good strato.	0
well, what was yours?	0
pardon me ,  caesar; because my dear ,  dear love to your advancement bids me tell you this; and reason is responsible to my love .	0
i can do anything !	0
get up early tomorrow—at the sound of the lark—noble norfolk .	0
why ,  is not this better now than groaning for love ?	0
ay me !	0
but i have spoke with one that saw him die, who did report that very frankly he confess'd his treasons, implored your highness’ pardon, and set forth a deep repentance.	0
a sail ,  a sail ,  a sail !	0
he ,  that caliban whom now i keep in service .	0
is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour ?	0
i took the hint and spoke to her .	0
why, friends, you go to do you know not what.	0
isn’t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?	0
he’s slain .	0
she durst not lie near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.	0
you were wrong to give away your wife’s first gift so thoughtlessly ,  a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body .	0
give me your hand .	0
i know you two are rival enemies; how does this gentle concord in the world come about ,  that hatred is so far from jealousy that you can sleep without fear ?	0
on the condition that publius shall not live, who is your nephew, mark antony.	0
a dollar .	0
his mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers .	0
masters, you are all welcome.	0
what is my nation ?	0
away with the good stools, remove the china closet, look to the plate.	0
goodbye ,  my desdemona .	0
your old smock brings forth a new petticoat ,  and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .	0
true ,  my lord .	0
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed?	0
speak ,  pyramus . —thisbe ,  stand forth .	0
monster ,  lay to your fingers .	0
dead art thou !	0
let's figure out how to do this.	0
have a good morning .	0
waking] and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake.	0
your wife octavia ,  with her modest eyes and still conclusion ,  shall acquire no honor demuring upon me .	0
now, my titania, wake up, my sweet queen.	0
where is he ?	0
because you have been as one, that in suffering all, that suffers nothing, a man that fortune's feasts and rewards have taken with equal thanks, and blessed are those whose blood and judgment are so well blended that they are not an instrument for fortune's finger to play whatever song she pleases.	0
by heaven, i saw my handkerchief in his hand.	0
sweet moon ,  i thank you for your sunny beams .	0
not one ,  my lord .	0
well ,  sir ,  because silver has a sweet sound .	0
i’m telling you the truth .	0
why ,  the wrong is but a wrong in the world; and having the world for your work ,  it is a wrong in your own world ,  and you might quickly make it right .	0
where do you dwell?	0
more of us are here .	0
and ,  gentle puck ,  take this transformed ass’s head off of the head of that athenian man ,  so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do ,  they can all go back to athens .	0
two thousand souls and twenty thousand dollars will not settle the question of who owns this worthless land .	0
you'll not endure him !	0
i cannot think it .	0
it is some meteor that the sun exhales to be to thee this night a torchbearer and light thee on thy way to mantua .	0
answer every man directly .	0
all's well.	0
or had a friend who would be a man for me !	0
they that have done this deed are honorable .	0
by heaven, i’ll make a ghost of him that holds me back!	0
pindarus !	0
something’s wrong ,  the man sounds panicked .	0
i give away myself for you and dote upon the exchange .	0
here's our chief guest.	0
i can’t speak anymore .	0
no ,  not at all ,  sir .	0
ate at home ?	0
if it’s good ,  why do i give in to that suggestion whose horrid image makes my hair stand on end ,  and makes my heart pound so hard they knock at my ribs ,  against my will to stay calm ?	0
i’m telling the truth .	0
but i will not stir from this place ,  do what they can .	0
this used to be contradictory ,  but now the time proves it’s true .	0
hello, ho, ho, my lord!	0
cassius ,  what night this is !	0
i have more care to stay than will to go.	0
where’s my son edmund ?	0
now ,  death ,  you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .	0
so he is now in getting any bold or noble job done; however ,  he pretends to be slow in nature .	0
my sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before .	0
i’ll be back soon ,  and if i haven’t brought you anything to eat ,  i will give you permission to die .	0
and if i cannot ,  i’ll find those that shall .	0
so our leader’s led ,  and we are women’s men .	0
what may you be ?	0
let me see her.	0
as a friend or an enemy ?	0
i’d rather go without the money .	0
my oberon !	0
and women .	0
cassio, walk hereabout.	0
dromio ,  bring this money to the centaur inn ,  where we’re lodging ,  and wait there until i come .	0
i held the sword, and he did run on it.	0
you see her eyes are open .	0
who keeps her company ?	0
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france ?	0
and we will mend thy wages .	0
tis bitter cold ,  and i am sick at heart .	0
sad hours seem long.	0
be thou assured, good cassio, i will do all my abilities in thy behalf.	0
nothing ,  but this is true .	0
why ,  then thou canst not break her to the lute ?	0
or shall we on without apology?	0
to the spirits] well done !	0
o child !	0
you’re right .	0
as the indifferent children of the earth.	0
i will lay trust upon thee ,  and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love .	0
ring the alarms bell .	0
that’s nothing to worry about; you shall play it with a mask on, and you can make your voice as light as you want.	0
boy ,  i beg you to run to the senate house .	0
nice to see you again ,  horatio—that is your name ,  right ?	0
what a storm !	0
indeed ,  he is so .	0
spakest thou of juliet?	0
and more i beg not.	0
do you think you’ve won ?	0
i’ll play the part wearing either a straw - colored beard ,  or a sandy beard ,  or a red beard ,  or one of those bright yellow beards that’s the color of a french coin .	0
where be these knaves ?	0
then ,  if they die unprovided ,  no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited .	0
i did enact julius caesar, i was killed in the capitol, brutus killed me.	0
no ,  by mine honor ,  madam .	0
i am stuffed ,  cousin .	0
i nursed her daughter that you talked withal .	0
i’m very afraid of banquo .	0
the danes ,  the germans ,  and the dutch—come on ,  drink ,  drink ! —are nothing compared to the english .	0
shall i be your slave ?	0
you look angerly .	0
why  “ with some little train ,  ”  my lord of buckingham ?	0
silence !	0
they mean to warn us at philippi here ,  answering before we do demand of them .	0
give me my sword .	0
but ere they came , –o ,  let me say no more !	0
he must do this ,  or i’ll recant the pardon i just delivered .	0
it makes us ,  or it mars us .	0
honest lord ,  what you say is true ,  because some of you there present are worse than devils .	0
you must not think that we are made of stuff so flat and dull that we can let our beard be shook with danger, and think it pastime.	0
good morning ,  my friends .	0
i'll cross it, though it blast me.	0
indeed i’ll never be satisfied with romeo till i see him dead .	0
what a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don’t know me !	0
you’ll have your nephews neigh to you .	0
my lord ,  he hath importuned me with love in honourable fashion .	0
and the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the poles ,  traveling on the ice in sleds .	0
i just beg death to wait awhile ,  until i place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips .	0
you are a villain .	0
how can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you’re out of breath ?	0
i do believe 'twas he.	0
it doth appear you are a worthy judge .	0
o, forgive me my sins!	0
oh ,  i die for food .	0
i will here be with thee presently ,  and if i bring thee not something to eat ,  i will give thee leave to die .	0
my forces are growing ,  and everything i know tells me it’s all coming together .	0
but  hello ,  my lord ,  how have you been doing lately ?	0
and to that end we wished your lordship here t' avoid the censures of the carping world .	0
i had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth, than to either of these.	0
that young swain that you saw here but erewhile ,  that little cares for buying anything .	0
katherina ,  you may stay .	0
virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin ,  and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .	0
my lord bassanio ,  since you have found antonio ,  we two will leave you .	0
a fox you’ve trapped and such a daughter should both be slaughtered ,  if my fool’s cap is worth a rope to bind them .	0
oh wicked wall ,  through which i don’t see any happiness !	0
unfaithful to me!	0
such as i am ,  i come from antony .	0
i hope you will consider that what i have spoken comes from my love; but i see you're upset .	0
isn’t someone waiting for me, cinna?	0
my wife!	0
what are they that do play it ?	0
but note me ,  signor—	0
oh ,  excellent young man !	0
who’s that ?	0
soft!	0
i will say so .	0
o noble caesar !	0
what’s she doing now?	0
speak not so grossly . —you are all amazed .	0
i’ll tell twenty lies like that ,  so men will think i graduated from school at least a year ago .	0
this business is well ended .	0
then, i defy you, stars!	0
yes ,  other men have ill luck too .	0
it is very proper the lord bassanio live an upright life ,  because ,  having such a blessing in his lady ,  he finds the joys of heaven here on earth; and if he doesn’t merit it on earth ,  it stands to reason he should never enter heaven .	0
he’s an admirable man .	0
then ,  tell me ,  who's the next heir of naples ?	0
alas ,  alas !	0
i’m here; what do you want?	0
and the one who commands us is our king .	0
raise all my kindred .	0
you’re better off because of your friends .	0
not a jot more, my lord.	0
what harmony is this ?	0
and there the snake throws her enameled skin ,  weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in .	0
this paper tells me of ten thousand frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .	0
what cares these roarers for the name of the king ?	0
a goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons, denmark being one o' the worst.	0
safely stowed .	0
take note, take note, o world, to be direct and honest is not safe.	0
i cry you mercy.	0
affection !  ”  that’s nothing !	0
be not fond to think that caesar bears such rebel blood that will be thaw'd from the true quality with that which melteth fools ,  i mean sweet words ,  low - crooked court'sies ,  and base spaniel - fawning .	0
well ,  that’s the same thing .	0
tell them to slick down their hair ,  brush their blue coats ,  and make sure their socks match .	0
follow your spirit ,  and as you charge cry ,   “ god for harry ,  england ,  and saint george !  ”	0
and the right valiant banquo was out too late ,  whom ,  you may say ,  if it please you ,  was killed by fleance ,  because fleance fled .	0
ay me ,  detested !	0
no ,  please ,  save it for dinner conversation .	0
love can transpose things that are low and ugly ,  having no good qualities at all ,  into things that have beauty and dignity .	0
i have said it.	0
who's there, i’ the name of belzebub?	0
go get ready .	0
it is here!	0
hold off the earth awhile ,  till i have caught her once more in mine arms .	0
do you not hear me speak ?	0
also against nature .	0
you’re getting in the way of our work .	0
if this isn’t what you’ve been hoping for ,  i have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to bianca forever .	0
methinks i could not die anywhere so contented as in the king’s company ,  his cause being just and his quarrel honorable .	0
he’s a very proper man .	0
o happy dagger!	0
but, if you knew to whom you show this honour, how true a gentleman you send relief, how dear a lover of my lord your husband, i know you would be prouder of the work, than customary bounty can enforce you.	0
follow me ,  then .	0
if the earth could be flooded with woman's tears ,  each drop she lets fall would prove to be a crocodile .	0
my lord?	0
shut the doors on him ,  that he may play the fool nowhere else but in his own house .	0
therefore ,  accept my everlasting farewell .	0
a quarrel ,  ho ,  already ?	0
oh ,  i’m sick ,  sick !	0
good hamlet, take off your black looks, and let your eye look on the king like a friend.	0
the thane of cawdor lives, a prosperous gentleman; and to be king stands not within the prospect of belief, no more than to be cawdor.	0
now ,  this overacting ,  or lateness ,  though it make the ignorant laugh ,  can only make the experienced grieve ,  in whose opinion ,  you must outdo a whole theatre of other audiences in your performance .	0
high - day ,  freedom !	0
i would have him nine years akilling .	0
it is almost morning, and yet, i am sure, you are not satisfied of these events at full.	0
the best news is that we have safely found our king and company; the next ,  our ship ,  which but three glasses since we gave out split ,  is tight and yare and bravely rigged as when we first put out to sea .	0
you have often begun to tell me what i am ,  but stopped and left me to a bootless inquisition ,  concluding ‘stay ,  not yet . ’ the hour's now come; the very minute bids thee ope thine ear ,  obey ,  and be attentive .	0
i am old now ,  and these same crosses spoil me .	0
lord ,  how art thou changed !	0
my royal lord, you don’t give the toast.	0
nothing at all .	0
seyton!	0
my mistress with a monster is in love .	0
where ?	0
if god had been willing ,  i wish we had died in the same hour too !	0
twas i that killed her .	0
i must once in a month recount what thou hast been ,  which thou forget’st .	0
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice so entirely ?	0
curse me, if i would do such a wrong thing for the whole world.	0
good love ,  call him back .	0
we do it wrong ,  being so majestical ,  to offer it the show of violence; for it is ,  as the air ,  invulnerable ,  and our vain blows malicious mockery .	0
why did you once seem lovely to me ?	0
even so great men great losses should endure .	0
i do, mark antony.	0
please just name a time ,  but don’t wait more than three days .	0
for when rich villains have need of poor ones ,  poor ones may make what price they will .	0
here in her hairs ,  the painter plays the spider; and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men ,  faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes , — how could he see to do them ?	0
such as she says my lord said i was .	0
speak .	0
tis not fit thus to obey him .	0
three times ,  and the hedgehog whined once .	0
the king, the king's to blame.	0
that drop of blood that's in control says i’m a bastard ,  cries my father’s wife was unfaithful ,  brands the harlot even here ,  between the chaste unmarked brows of my true mother .	0
a plague on the tyrant that i serve!	0
this if she perform ,  she shall not sue unheard .	0
so ,  oft it chances in particular men ,  that for some vicious mole of nature in them ,  as in their birth—wherein they are not guilty ,  since nature cannot choose his origin— by the o'ergrowth of some complexion ,  oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason ,  or by some habit that too much o'erleavens the form of plausive manners ,  that these men— carrying ,  i say ,  the stamp of one defect ,  being nature's livery ,  or fortune's star— their virtues else—be they as pure as grace ,  as infinite as man may undergo— shall in the general censure take corruption from that particular fault .	0
come ,  will you go with me ?	0
what, shall i find you here?	0
think it no more .	0
you may to me, and it is most proper you should.	0
what news, my lord?	0
forgive us our sins !	0
with her ,  on top of her—however you want to say it .	0
tis very strange .	0
orsino .	0
my lord sebastian, the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in—you rub the sore, when you should bring the plaster.	0
i say again ,  give out that anne my queen is sick and like to die .	0
do you know, sirrah, where lieutenant cassio lies?	0
why ,  it is not possible .	0
bring him with us .	0
help !	0
things base and vile ,  holding no quantity ,  love can transpose to form and dignity .	0
so all hail, macbeth and banquo!	0
sir ,  i know you ,  and i trust you enough to share something very important with you .	0
he hath ,  my lord ,  of late made many tenders of his affection to me .	0
mistress ,  upon my life i tell you true .	0
thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate ,  but certain issue strokes must arbitrate; towards which ,  advance the war .	0
what part is that ,  my lord ?	0
to him ,  sir topas .	0
you are welcome .	0
ay, marry, are they, sir.	0
dear sir ,  i pity the lady and wish—more for her sake than my own—that i was more able to help her .	0
but what do say you to thursday?	0
irreparable is the loss ,  and patience says it is past her cure .	0
in that case it’s your imagination that’s interesting ,  not the play .	0
yes ,  ma'am .	0
this murderous shaft that's shot hath not yet lighted, and our safest way is to avoid the aim.	0
but ,  pity the time !	0
more or less .	0
since they plotted with the dark god of the underworld to kidnap my daughter, i have sworn not to be in her and her blind boy's scandalous company.	0
you know he does .	0
here ,  wear this jewel for me .	0
name him .	0
i will walk around and mingle with all of you ,  playing the humble host .	0
never believe it.	0
now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york ,  and all the clouds that loured upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried .	0
where is gentle rivers ,  vaughan ,  grey ?	0
fare you well .	0
i’m not afraid of anyone but him .	0
i thought your heart had been wounded by a lion’s claws .	0
she’s ready to go ,  but she’ll never return .	0
he'll be hanged yet, though every drop of water swear against it, and gape at wid'st to glut him.	0
your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come ,  for sure the man is tainted in ’s wits .	0
ah me!	0
was i even close to you in the chase for the goose ?	0
look ,  sir .	0
but for the seventh cause .	0
why ,  now ,  as fast as she can marry us .	0
go tell the king i want to talk to him for a few minutes .	0
to all and him we thirst ,  and all to all .	0
do all your conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils, boil down to this?	0
that lord that counseled thee to give away thy land ,  come place him here by me .	0
are you starting to challenge me ?	0
so please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.	0
if you do love me you will find me out . — nerissa and the rest ,  stand all aloof .	0
it is a creature that dotes on cassio ,  as 'tis the strumpet's plague to beguile many and be beguiled by one .	0
and now she’ll start moaning ,  of course— are you asleep ,  my love ?	0
this is some minx's token ,  and i must take out the work ?	0
i partly know the man .	0
now am i dead ,  now am i fled; my soul is in the sky .	0
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra .	0
and come you now with  “ knocking at the gate ”  ?	0
enough of this frivolous talk .	0
who is there?	0
tell him so yourself ,  and see how he takes the news .	0
we’ll rise and leave early tomorrow .	0
then, i’ll attack you with my wit!	0
to ireland, i; our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer.	0
good gentlemen ,  look like you’re rested and happy .	0
what is the matter ?	0
he’ll find out soon what happened in england .	0
they have made themselves agree, and that agreement now doesn’t agree with you.	0
the man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .	0
i hope you’re lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .	0
what !	0
for three months; right?	0
transform me ,  then ,  and to your power i’ll yield .	0
mine would ,  sir ,  were i human .	0
whither away ?	0
that's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.	0
i won’t be afraid of blow flies.	0
one, gentlewoman, that god has made for himself to damage.	0
and therefore ,  since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair well - spoken days ,  i am determinèd to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days .	0
what are these things with shrunken skin and wild clothes ,  that don’t look not like they live on earth ,  only are still on it ?	0
what do you mean ,  get rid of him ?	0
pardon my crime ,  sovereign ,  but not my person .	0
why ,  what an intricate impeach is this !	0
as you all know ,  overconfidence is man’s greatest enemy .	0
by all the gods that romans bow before ,  i here discard my sickness !	0
if any be trinculo’s legs ,  these are they .	0
put the torch out ,  so i can’t be seen .	0
this ensign here of mine was turning back; i slew the coward ,  and did take it from him .	0
tis truly so.	0
signior fabian ,  stay you by this gentleman till my return .	0
how do you understand the scripture ?	0
it has hatched a    i go unwillingly .	0
tis done .	0
even like that, lucilius.	0
we know we shall die ,  we know; it’s only time and drawing days out that men live on .	0
and why did you come ?	0
in faith, he's penitent; and yet his trespass, in our common reason— save that, they say, the wars must make examples out of their best—is not almost a fault to incur a private check.	0
flout ’em and scout ’em ,  and scout ’em and flout ’em thought is free .	0
he has much fertile land.	0
joy, gentle friends, joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts!	0
i do remember me ,  henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king ,  when richmond was a little peevish boy .	0
why do we wrap the gen -  tleman in our more rawer breath ?	0
faith, i must, or else she'll raise a ruckus in the street.	0
he is ready at the door: he comes ,  my lord .	0
madam ,  not now .	0
tie up my love’s tongue .	0
bernardo ?	0
conscience ,  ”  i say ,   “ you give good advice .  ”   “ devil ,  ”  i say ,   “ you give good advice .  ”  if i listened to my conscience ,  i’d stay with the jew my master ,  who’s a devil .	0
need you my help?	0
in love?	0
i’ll do my best to woo your lady— whoe'er i woo ,  myself would be his wife .	0
i will read it.	0
a cry within] a plague [a cry within] a plague upon this howling!	0
turn ,  hell - hound ,  turn !	0
what ,  ho !	0
i’ll fume with them !  ”  and with that word she struck me on the head ,  and through the instrument my pate made way ,	0
indeed ?	0
o single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!	0
shall i be married then to-morrow morning?	0
promise me you’ll let me live ,  and i’ll confess the truth .	0
come ,  come !	0
ay ,  on the front .	0
ay, springes to catch woodcocks.	0
this is just what the letter said .	0
and this cuff was but to knock at your ear and beseech list'ning .	0
i am hers .	0
is it within reason and can be done?	0
now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom .	0
myself ?	0
gracious olivia— what do you say ,  cesario ? —good my lord— my lord would speak .	0
thou art to die .	0
who is't that cried!	0
his name's gonzago .	0
yes ,  do you hear me ,  balthasar ?	0
o ,  the blood of my dear kinsman is spilled !	0
curse you for telling me that, because it has intimidated my better part of man!	0
but you have to .	0
who can be wise, amazed, temperate, and furious, loyal and neutral, in a moment?	0
no ,  i pray thee speak in sober judgment .	0
who are you ?	0
what kind of loyalty is this ?	0
here i lie and will never get up again .	0
you speak not as you think .	0
indeed ,  to speak feelingly of him ,  he is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gen -  tleman would see .	0
do you see ,  gentlemen ?	0
yet i will adventure .	0
isn’t someone waiting for me ?	0
we’ll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .	0
i will bring you there .	0
happier than this— she is not bred so dull but she can learn .	0
that death is unnatural that kills for loving.	0
god be with you.	0
the jove of power make me most weak ,  most weak ,  your reconciler !	0
good countrymen, let me leave alone, and, for my sake, stay here with antony.	0
go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions ,  shorten up their sinews with agèd cramps ,  and more pinch - spotted make them than pard or cat o' mountain .	0
hamlet return'd shall know you are come home .	0
well, that’s how i will grow, live, and die, my lord, before i will give up my virginity to his lordship.	0
if not ,  leave me alone ,  and i’ll stay away from your turf .	0
but don’t go with it !	0
here is a friar ,  trembling ,  sighing ,  and weeping .	0
so thrive my soul— a thousand times good night!	0
no ,  gentle madam .	0
are not you moved ,  when all the sway of earth shakes like a thing unfirm ?	0
you may go to the devil’s dam !	0
well ,  if a moist palm isn’t a clear sign of promiscuity ,  then i can’t scratch my own ear .	0
but what are you doing in elsinore ?	0
this do i drink to thee.	0
he’s not thy kinsman .	0
find some occasion to make cassio angry, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his discipline, or from whatever reason you please, which might be suggested by what’s happening at the time.	0
now there can only be the promise .	0
if thou lovest me then, steal forth thy father's house tomorrow night; and in the wood, a league without the town, where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may, there will i stay for thee.	0
where love is great ,  the littlest doubts are very fearful ,  where little fears grow great ,  great love also grows there .	0
there's a fearful point!	0
and let him ply his music .	0
haply the seas and countries different with variable objects shall expel this something - settled matter in his heart ,  whereon his brains still beating puts him thus from fashion of himself .	0
but there was a rumor—you know ,  people always gossip about royalty—that he was in love with the beautiful olivia .	0
he left behind myself and my twin sister ,  who was born in the same hour as me .	0
o son ,  the night before thy wedding day hath death lain with thy wife .	0
i'll send her to you presently; and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way ,  that your converse and business may be more free .	0
goodbye.	0
away ,  then !	0
no .	0
you’ve said what you have to say now .	0
tybalt was my nephew !	0
even so ?	0
doesn’t she think i’m an old murderer, now i have stained the beginning of our joy with blood from a close relative?	0
tis a blushing ,  shamefaced spirit that mutinies in a man’s bosom .	0
must she not then be answered ?	0
don’t let us talk you into anything ,  but consider carefully the value of our offers .	0
for all the rest ,  they'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk; they'll tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour .	0
finally the new moon ,  curved like a silver bow in the sky ,  will look down on our wedding celebration .	0
cassio ?	0
what man is that ?	0
i would choose to take my penalty .	0
dost thou hear ?	0
sir ,  i cannot .	0
put a lot of cash together .	0
don’t look so sour .	0
to mourn a mischief that is past and gone is the next way to draw new mischief on.	0
if it be a suit from the count ,  i am sick ,  or not at home .	0
i have been sexton here ,  man and boy ,  thirty years .	0
throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth, from whence you have them.	0
but, i beg you, sir, are you really married?	0
damn your stones for disappointing me like this !	0
no ,  i do not know you ,  nor i am not sent to you by my lady ,  to bid you come speak with her ,  nor your name is not master cesario ,  nor this is not my nose neither .	0
if he becomes pale ,  i know what to do .	0
what says romeo ?	0
be as ourself in denmark .	0
what’s up ,  daughter and niece ?	0
i know how they think ,  and i understand why they’re doing this .	0
the clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it .	0
and the rarest person that ever came there .	0
we are all are punished .	0
this would be enough to make my husband suspect me ,  if he wasn’t so free of jealousy .	0
monday, my lord.	0
i will speak to this fellow.	0
ugly ,  wrinkled witch ,  what are you doing here ?	0
i’m only trying to keep the peace.	0
my letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .	0
i would like to get to know you better ,  good master cobweb .	0
it is the most difficult to understand dog that ever stayed with men.	0
your highness will have to force me to tell .	0
our gracious brother ,  i will go with them .	0
now, if this suit lay in bianca's power, how quickly should you speed!	0
octavia has a pious ,  chaste ,  meek disposition .	0
my husband !	0
this damned witch sycorax was kicked out of algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about .	0
you will not blame us in your funeral speech ,  but will say all the good you want to about caesar and that you do it by our permission .	0
and immediately come yourselves and bring messala with you to us.	0
my father watches .	0
me ,  poor man ,  my library was dukedom large enough .	0
how does it go with my magnificent mark antony ?	0
a gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips— not body's death ,  but body's banishment .	0
kneel not ,  gentle portia .	0
then there’s the count palatine .	0
i will choose this one and try my chances .	0
if you meet the prince in the night ,  you may stay him .	0
wilt thou go with me ?	0
to who ,  my lord ? —who hath the office ?	0
good my lord ,  tell it .	0
will you come with us ?	0
give me some light .	0
you can take your chances after dinner .	0
i do beseech ye ,  if you bear me hard ,  now ,  whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke ,  fulfill your pleasure .	0
sir ,  it’s the moor .	0
if partially connected or together in office ,  you deliver more or less than truth ,  you are no soldier .	0
now is the wall down between the two neighbors .	0
you are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would lift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it five weeks without changing.	0
well ,  that’s how i will grow ,  live ,  and die ,  my lord ,  before i will give up my virginity to his lordship .	0
i’ll tell you ,  there is good men porn at monmouth .	0
beware the ides of march .	0
diseases desperate grown by desperate appliance are relieved ,  or not at all .	0
soft ,  caesar .	0
he is gone, he is gone, and we cast away moan.	0
go on ,  my loving lord .	0
i'll take my leave of the jew in the twinkling of an eye .	0
never at quiet .	0
why ,  fare thee well ,  king .	0
invite all my sad captains .	0
is it e'en so ?	0
nurse ?	0
how will you do for a father ?	0
but i don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth .	0
what wood is this before us?	0
your mother.	0
ah ,  mine own lord ,  what have i seen tonight !	0
worthy cawdor !	0
i thank you for your company ,  but ,  good faith ,  i had as lief have been myself alone .	0
but here’s the plan: our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .	0
o limed soul, that, struggling to be free, art more engaged!	0
a trade ,  sir ,  that i hope i may use with a clear conscience ,  which is indeed ,  sir ,  a mender of bad soles .	0
you have known what you should not .	0
more torches here!	0
i need a doctor .	0
i remember your eyes quite well .	0
take your face out of here .	0
one turf shall serve as pillow for us both; one heart, one bed, two bosoms, and one troth.	0
nay then ,  i will not .	0
go ,  mardian ,  and let me know how he reacts to my death .	0
i would rather wrong the dead ,  and wrong myself and you ,  than wrong such honorable men .	0
amen!	0
o ,  falsely ,  falsely murdered !	0
sport ?	0
i’m sorry to find you like this .	0
you don’t know me ,  but i know you’re an important person .	0
made she no verbal question ?	0
why ,  every day ,  tomorrow .	0
therefore i have entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night, that if again this apparition come he may approve our eyes and speak to it.	0
madam !	0
lives ,  sir .	0
the odds is gone ,  and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon .	0
blessings on you !	0
look like th' innocent flower ,  but be the serpent under ’t .	0
moneys is your suit .	0
honor, riches, marriage-blessing, long life, and many children, hourly joys be always yours!	0
tut ,  i am in their bosoms ,  and i know wherefore they do it .	0
they’re all dead .	0
i think i’ve found one already ,  thanks to you ,  my lord .	0
so that you shall surely find him ,  lead these searchers to the sagittary inn ,  and i will be there with him .	0
why ,  my young cousin ?	0
hold him in custody until the prince gets here .	0
nay ,  yet there’s more in this .	0
but i must tell thee plainly ,  claudio undergoes my challenge ,  and either i must shortly hear from him ,  or i will subscribe him a coward .	0
if it be not for some purpose of import ,  give ’t me again .	0
o soft ,  sir !	0
up and down ,  up and down; i will lead them up and down .	0
welcome, gentlemen!	0
dismiss me?	0
are not you a strumpet?	0
this is othello's ancient, as i take it.	0
who brought them ?	0
may you only give birth to male children ,  because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn’t masculine .	0
a spirit i am indeed ,  but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb i did participate .	0
no.	0
we will.	0
how does thy honour?	0
mark antony,— pardon me, caius cassius.	0
and i will give you another one .	0
alas the day, i never gave him reason!	0
you have astonished him .	0
and why do you blame me for loving you ?	0
they say they have letters for you .	0
what's the news from venice?	0
o heaven defend me !	0
is thy union here?	0
beguiled ,  divorcèd ,  wrongèd ,  spited ,  slain !	0
i have it not about me .	0
there are things in this comedy of “pyramus and thisbe” that will never please an audience.	0
this is very true ,  and he begged me to invite your majesties to hear and see the play .	0
by heaven, you do me wrong.	0
how shall we try it ?	0
i am very glad to see you ,  signior; welcome to cyprus .	0
and i’m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little ,  i need to scratch .	0
the jewels you took from me to deliver to desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me .	0
and now to our french causes .	0
would i could answer this comfort with the like .	0
your part in her you could not keep from death ,  but heaven keeps his part in eternal life .	0
gentlemen ,  let's look to our business .	0
look to the queen there ,  ho !	0
and what say’st thou then to my love ?	0
now i’m scared again .	0
but how hath she receiv'd his love ?	0
since that my beauty cannot please his eye ,  i’ll weep what’s left away ,  and weeping die .	0
no, by mine honour, madam, by my soul, no woman had it, but a civil doctor, which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begg'd the ring; the which i did deny him, and suffer'd him to go displeas'd away; even he that had uphold the very life of my dear friend.	0
go bid thy mistress ,  when my drink is ready ,  she strike upon the bell .	0
now, good angels preserve the king.	0
my lord ,  there was no such stuff in my thoughts .	0
i am not well in health ,  and that is all .	0
and i'll still stay, to have thee still forget, forgetting any other home but this.	0
persever ,  counterfeit sad looks ,  make mouths upon me when i turn my back ,  wink each at other ,  hold the sweet jest up— this sport ,  well carried ,  shall be chronicled .	0
where’s peaseblossom ?	0
the duke’s in a meeting right now ,  and he’s sent for you too .	0
you mock me ,  sir .	0
you will be boastful!	0
but, goodbye!	0
don’t you know me ,  father ?	0
i like you very much .	0
and prompt me ,  plain and holy innocence !	0
nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither .	0
hey, daughter!	0
what the traitor has lost ,  noble macbeth has won .	0
nor i .	0
farewell ,  good launcelot .	0
my oberon !	0
but ,  sure ,  the bravery of his grief did put me into a towering passion .	0
please, recognize me when we meet again: i wish you well, and so i say goodbye.	0
the best plays are only shadows, and the worst are no worse, if imagination can fill in the gaps.	0
into my grave?	0
so how did it go ,  sir ?	0
have patience ,  sir .	0
come, my dear love, the purchase made, the fruits are to ensue; that profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.	0
no ,  ’twas the vane on the house .	0
o valiant cousin !	0
stand close; this is the same athenian .	0
let him approach .	0
i know her answer .	0
o god!	0
sailors ,  sir .	0
this rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, which gives men stomach to digest his words with better appetite.	0
we shall, my lord, perform what you command us.	0
not someone who doesn’t share that disposition ,  meaning mark antony .	0
honest ,  my lord ?	0
to ireland ,  i; our separated fortune shall keep us both the safer .	0
father ,  wife ,  friends—farewell !	0
if your highness is willing ,  take revenge on him for that—because i know you’re brave enough ,  i don’t dare to— that’s for sure .	0
but stop ,  i say .	0
should i not say ,   “ hath a dog money ?	0
i mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.	0
hast thou not a word of joy ?	0
your wit is a very bitter sweetness; it is a most sharp sauce .	0
has this fellow no feeling of his business ,  that he sings at grave - making ?	0
how now ,  cassio !	0
here he comes ,  and the scots captain ,  captain jamy ,  with him .	0
god give you joy ,  petruchio .	0
how much salt water was thrown away in waste, to season love, that did not taste love!	0
are you going to pay the eight shillings i won from you in a bet ?	0
marry ,  sir ,  with needle and thread .	0
here’s my servant .	0
but ,  as they say ,  to hear music the general does not greatly care .	0
do that good mischief which may make this island thine own for ever ,  and i ,  thy caliban ,  for aye thy foot - licker .	0
swear your love for each other .	0
farewell .	0
what ,  not to pray ?	0
what ,  not a word ?	0
i do: and surely it is a sleepy language ,  and you talk in your sleep .	0
i cannot hope caesar and antony shall well greet together .	0
the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace ,  but by his mother was perforce withheld .	0
this letter he early bid me give his father ,  and threat'ned me with death ,  going in the vault ,  if i departed not and left him there .	0
the rest of the dead are princes ,  barons ,  lords ,  knights ,  squires ,  and gentlemen of birth and rank .	0
now i perceive they have conjoined all three to fashion this false sport ,  in spite of me . — injurious hermia !	0
what will i do ,  thinkest thou ?	0
a good man’s fortune may grow out at heels .	0
drown thyself?	0
how if fair and foolish ?	0
i had rather give his carcass to my hounds .	0
go ,  biondello ,  bid your mistress come to me .	0
i know what reason i have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad ,  i would divorce me from thy mother’s tomb ,  sepulchring an adultress .	0
thus decoration is only the deceived shore to a most dangerous sea; the beautiful scarf veiling an indian beauty; in a word ,  the seeming truth which skillful times dress in to fool the wisest men .	0
be you and i behind an arras then; mark the encounter .	0
well, say, sir.	0
tis no time to play now.	0
i understand not what you mean by this .	0
is it a weakness ?	0
the crow sings as sweetly as the lark when either is waited on ,  and i think the nightingale ,  if she sang by day ,  when every goose is cackling ,  would be considered no better a musician than the wren .	0
this is rebellion .	0
but try to control your speech .	0
i remember .	0
ay ,  madam ,  it is common .	0
his ship is heavily timbered, and his captain is very experienced and has a good reputation; therefore my hopes, not excessively fed to death, stand in heavy anxiety.	0
so please you, something touching the lord hamlet.	0
pinch my nose ?	0
i am not merry ,  but i do beguile the thing i am by seeming otherwise .	0
here .	0
there’s not a man in all athens able to play pyramus but he .	0
curse my father’s ambition !	0
what news ?	0
now sir ,  this granted—as it is a most pregnant and unforced position—who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as cassio does ?	0
look ,  here comes the fool .	0
what's the matter?	0
fut ,  i should have been that i am ,  had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing .	0
anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .	0
i have a widow aunt ,  a dowager of great revenue ,  and she hath no child .	0
no ,  it’s not as deep as a well ,  or as wide as a church door ,  but it’s enough .	0
alas ,  then she is drowned ?	0
no indeed ,  my lord .	0
but first i will release the fairy queen .	0
news, lads!	0
come ,  march to wakes and fairs and market towns .	0
they should advance immediately ,  because i sense octavius’s side is a bit fainthearted right now ,  and a sudden push would overthrow him .	0
why ,  how now ,  daughter katherine ?	0
though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose.	0
jove shield thee well for this !	0
my lord, that would dishonour him.	0
but ,  look !	0
what are you ,  that seizes this time of night ,  taking the same fair and warlike form in which the dead king of denmark ,  now buried ,  did sometimes march ?	0
indeed ,  the french may lay twenty french crowns to one they will beat us ,  for they bear them on their shoulders .	0
i am sped .	0
natures of such deep trust we shall much need .	0
well ,  you’ve given away all your other rightful titles .	0
doth not she think me an old murderer, now i have stain'd the childhood of our joy with blood remov'd but little from her own?	0
horatio, thou art e'en as just a man as e'er my conversation cop'd withal.	0
such wind as scatters young men through the world to seek their fortunes farther than at home ,  where small experience grows .	0
i’ve had enough of this  “ off with you !  ”  come on ,  let me in !	0
i can’t tell what you and other men think of this life; but ,  for myself alone ,  i would rather not live to be in awe of such a thing as i’m .	0
where are you hiding ?	0
who does i’ th’ wars more than his captain can becomes his captain’s captain; and ambition ,  the soldier’s virtue ,  rather makes choice of loss than gain which darkens him .	0
shall they see us ?	0
here comes the good macduff .	0
thieves !	0
my name is edgar ,  and thy father’s son .	0
but how is it that this lives in thy mind ?	0
he’s been gone for nine years and he’s leaving again soon .	0
draw thy sword and give me sufficing strokes for death .	0
therefore take heed how you impawn our person ,  how you awake our sleeping sword of war .	0
more shouting !	0
i will forget my nature .	0
lend me your cloak ,  sir thomas .	0
while he was alive ,  i lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .	0
let him be caesar .	0
isn’t today the day when hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she’ll marry demetrius ?	0
room for antony ,  most noble antony .	0
ah ,  how much might the man deserve of me that would right her !	0
every day thou daffest me with some device ,  iago; and rather ,  as it seems to me now ,  keepest from me all conve -  niency than suppliest me with the least advantage of hope .	0
i have made strong proof of my constancy ,  giving myself a voluntary wound here in the thigh .	0
now ,  by this hand ,  i swear ,  i scorn the term ,  nor shall my nell keep lodgers .	0
i'll lay fourteen of my teeth— and yet, to my teen be it spoken, i have but four— she is not fourteen.	0
kind gentlemen, your pains are register'd where every day i turn the leaf to read them.	0
who comes here ?	0
rebellion's head, rise never, till the wood of birnam rise, and our high-placed macbeth shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath to time and mortal custom.	0
there's ne'er a villain dwelling in all denmark but he's an arrant knave .	0
i'll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes .	0
i’m going on alone .	0
here’s that shall drive some of them to a noncome .	0
march gently on to meet him.	0
for my part ,  i’m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .	0
tis not for gravity to play at cherry - pit with satan .	0
please ,  marry us .	0
shall rome, &amp;c. speak, strike, redress!” “brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!” such instigations have been often dropp'd where i have took them up.	0
and to see how he prizes the foolish woman ,  your wife !	0
if i can’t do that ,  i can at least make the moor so jealous that he can’t think straight .	0
maybe he is not well .	0
a peevish self - will'd harlotry it is .	0
for brutus' sake ,  i am beholding to you .	0
what’s up ,  roderigo !	0
if you nod, you’ll break your harp; i'll take it from you, and, good boy, good night.	0
where is he ?	0
but let him come.	0
alas, iago, what shall i do to win my lord again?	0
let us go in; and charge us there upon inter'gatories ,  and we will answer all things faithfully .	0
she turned to folly ,  and she was a whore .	0
when our actions do not make us traitors, our fears do.	0
give me your hand.	0
if it were now to die ,  'twere now to be most happy; for i fear my soul hath her content so absolute that not another comfort like to this succeeds in unknown fate .	0
be wise, and go home.	0
do you like this haste?	0
all hail, macbeth!	0
but is this law?	0
you’re mistaken about all that .	0
you’re a smart guy .	0
a segregation of the turkish fleet .	0
pink for flower.	0
it is enacted in the laws of venice, that, if it is proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen, the party against whom he schemes shall seize one half his goods; the other half comes to the public treasury of the state; and the offender's life lies at the mercy of the duke only, above all others.	0
not now .	0
i think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from wales and bring him to london to be crowned our king .	0
come ,  thou gentle day .	0
the taming school ?	0
no ,  you must see with your father’s eyes .	0
it’s born of my  a witty mother !	0
farewell till then .	0
in troth, i think thou wouldst not.	0
my thanes and kinsmen ,  i name you all earls ,  the first earls that scotland has ever had .	0
i'll make you an example .	0
you may as well say ,  that’s a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion .	0
my lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .	0
o woeful day !	0
methought their souls whose bodies richard murdered came to my tent and cried on victory .	0
not with any sauce they could provide for them .	0
as you are to yourself .	0
oh ,  sweet england !	0
these are but wild and whirling words, my lord.	0
i will survey th' inscriptions back again .	0
yes, shylock, i will seal unto this bond.	0
now much beshrew my manners and my pride ,  if hermia meant to say lysander lied !	0
out ,  cur !	0
he was a bachelor then .	0
go look for him .	0
or was it a blessing that we came here ?	0
i tell you ,  ’tis incredible to believe how much she loves me .	0
that is laertes, a very noble youth.	0
how’s the queen ?	0
will you still provoke me?	0
madam, good night.	0
then ’tis most like the sovereignty will fall upon macbeth .	0
how with mine honor may i give him that which i have given to you ?	0
none of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .	0
like a good doctor .	0
but hush, no more.	0
if it takes on my noble father's appearance, i’ll speak to it, though hell itself should open wide and order me to be silent.	0
an you will not be answered with reason ,  i must die .	0
more to know did never meddle with my thoughts.	0
casca ,  you are the first that rears your hand .	0
smile ,  then ,  on this beautiful union .	0
ay ,  at philippi .	0
my worthy cawdor !	0
she told her, while she kept it, 'twould make her amiable and subdue my father entirely to her love, but if she lost it or made a gift of it, my father's eye should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt after new fancies.	0
don’t let me hold you up ,  cassius ,  go if you like; i'll leave you .	0
dear general ,  i never gave you cause .	0
for who is living ,  if those two are gone ?	0
he lay there ,  stretched out like a wounded knight .	0
thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform, and i must use you in such another trick.	0
i can put him in the right mood ,  and i’ll bring him to the capitol .	0
yes ,  if messala will recommend me to you .	0
his daughters want to kill him .	0
be as thou wast wont to be; see as thou was wont to see .	0
and for my means ,  i’ll husband them so well ,  they shall go far with little .	0
went he hence now ?	0
oh ,  this is a painful time !	0
well ,  well ,  away .	0
stephano !	0
you are as wise as you are beautiful .	0
shall we call in the ambassador ,  my liege ?	0
lorenzo ,  and thy love .	0
what ,  the necklace ?	0
i’ll tell you all about my meetings, all the reasons for my sad brows.	0
othello !	0
did he ask for me ?	0
of brave earls ,  grandpré and roussi ,  fauconberg and foix ,  beaumont and marle ,  vaudemont and lestrale .	0
what years ,  i' faith ?	0
for what offence ?	0
he was but a fool that brought my answer back .	0
can he be angry?	0
the poor monster's my subject, and he shall not suffer indignity.	0
i pray you leave me .	0
let us haste to hear it, and call the noblest to the audience.	0
go with my brothers to my english peers .	0
tell me why you did it .	0
oh ,  that estates ,  degrees and offices were not derived corruptly ,  and that clear honor were purchased by the merit of the wearer !	0
the violence of either grief or joy destroys their own keeping of them with themselves.	0
my fairy lord ,  this must be done with haste .	0
what night-rule now about this haunted grove?	0
i need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don’t want any company .	0
no ,  i said his horse is coming ,  with him on its back .	0
who knocks so hard ?	0
and did you see the handkerchief ?	0
you’ve never thought of me like that ,  and you have no reason to .	0
when i have fought with the men ,  i will be civil with the maids; i will cut off their heads .	0
did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?	0
come like shadows and depart in the same way !	0
you are right .	0
and so do i .	0
i warrant ,  an i should live a thousand years ,  i never should forget it .	0
and, until she comes, as truly as i confess the vices of my blood to heaven, so i'll present truthfully, to your hearing, how i thrived in this beautiful lady's love, and she in mine.	0
so the life that died with shame lives on with fame .	0
how goes the world, sir, now?	0
you’re a liar!	0
i'll call upon you straight.	0
please ,  go away .	0
casca will tell us what the matter is .	0
from the four corners of the earth they come to kiss this shrine ,  this mortal breathing saint .	0
please you ,  farther .	0
i'faith, sweet love, i was coming to your house.	0
follow them ,  please .	0
i do not think it good.	0
he hath the falling sickness .	0
stand fast together, lest some friend of caesar's should chance— talk not of standing.	0
swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither .	0
then run away .	0
listen !	0
if he do fear god ,  he must necessarily keep peace .	0
a maiden never bold ,  of spirit so still and quiet that her motion blushed at herself .	0
get fuel for us and you had better be quick about answering the other business .	0
what wilt thou do ?	0
what play?	0
ne'er pull your hat upon your brows; give sorrow words.	0
master ,  shall i be porter at the gate ?	0
you’re both very precious to me .	0
o ,  this is counter ,  you false danish dogs !	0
my lord ?	0
i think he will stand strong with us .	0
now all labor mars what it does .	0
i dare no longer stay.	0
where did you leave him ?	0
you may to me ,  and it is most proper you should .	0
i conjure you ,  by that which you profess ,  howe'er you come to know it ,  answer me: though you untie the winds and let them fight against the churches ,  though the yeasty waves confound and swallow navigation up ,  though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down ,  though castles topple on their warders’ heads ,  though palaces and pyramids do slope their heads to their foundations ,  though the treasure of nature's germens tumble all together even till destruction sicken ,  answer me to what i ask you .	0
and isn’t ,  then ,  well served with a sweet goose ?	0
ah ,  good father ,  you see the heavens ,  troubled with man's acting ,  threaten his bloody stage .	0
the servants of capulet, and your servants, were fighting before i got there.	0
are you acquainted with the difference of opinion that is the present question before the court ?	0
was i with you there for the goose?	0
stephano !	0
antonio and old shylock, both come forward.	0
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; speak but one rhyme, and i am satisfied!	0
get thee gone .	0
what would you have, desdemona?	0
yes ,  she will .	0
his daughter ,  katherine ,  with some insignificant ,  unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .	0
do you think alexander the great looked like this in the earth ?	0
in what sense ,  my lord ?	0
ay ,  and this .	0
scarcity and want shall ignore you; ceres' blessing so be on you.	0
the phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannons by our sides.	0
i still fear him, because in the acquired love he bears to caesar— alas, good cassius, don’t think of him.	0
i would rather be married to a skull with a bone in his mouth than to either of these princes.	0
music i’ th’ air .	0
and you too ,  sir .	0
farewell.	0
eighty ducats !	0
indeed !	0
i wish your horses swift and sure of foot ,  and so i do commend you to their backs .	0
where’s your lute ?	0
has this fellow no feeling of his business ,  that he sings at grave - digging ?	0
say on; come to hecuba.	0
o, much i fear some ill unlucky thing.	0
it was mere foolery; i did not mark it.	0
she that makes dainty ,  she ,  i’ll swear ,  hath corns .	0
the fool’s a good actor .	0
when i spoke that ,  i was ill - tempered too .	0
i’ll help you .	0
so good night unto you all .	0
i’ll not fight with thee .	0
what is a traitor ?	0
beat me !	0
he cannot flatter ,  he .	0
that’s how it was with henry the sixth ,  who was crowned in paris when he was only nine months old .	0
here's such a coil !	0
call her to come to me.	0
but is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration ?	0
o ,  good sir ,  i do .	0
you know i say nothing to him; for he understands not me, nor i him: he hath neither latin, french, nor italian; and you will come into the court, and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english.	0
pale as thy smock!	0
don’t you recognize me ,  father ?	0
i'll teach you how to flow .	0
tell your piteous heart there’s no harm done .	0
what news ?	0
the obsequies that i for thee will keep nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep .	0
he said my eyes and my hair were black and ,  now that i think of it ,  he scorned me .	0
all men call thee fickle .	0
me believe it ?	0
tranio ,  you jest .	0
here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear blasting his wholesome brother.	0
now for ourself ,  and for this time of meeting .	0
how like you the young german ,  the duke of saxony's nephew ?	0
what, you shake at that?	0
i mean ,  what sort of man is he ?	0
thereby shall we shadow the numbers of our host and make discovery err in report of us .	0
the play's the thing wherein i’ll see the conscience of the king .	0
you take my life when you do take the means whereby i live .	0
now i see it is true ,  because banquo ,  with his hair matted with blood smiles upon me ,  and points at them for his .	0
o ,  fear me not .	0
yes ,  gentle cousin ,  if it were light enough for you .	0
madam, you have bereft me of all words; only my blood speaks to you in my veins, and there is such confusion in my powers, as, after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince, there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude; where every something, being blent together, turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy, express'd and not express'd.	0
those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel; but do not dull thy palm with entertainment of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade.	0
myself the man i' th' moon do seem to be— this is the greatest error of all the rest .	0
your head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat; and your head has even been beaten like a rotten egg for quarrelling.	0
he came to scatter flowers on his lady's grave ,  and asked me to stand off to the side ,  and so i did .	0
and so do i.	0
ourself will mingle with society and play the humble host .	0
this is illyria ,  lady .	0
tell me ,  you villainous lowlife ,  where are my children ?	0
congratulations ,  lady: you resemble a most honorable man .	0
what a sleep were this for your advancement!	0
do you know where i’m going ?	0
who’s shouting ?	0
and make him with fair aegle break his faith, with ariadne and antiopa?	0
what is do you need ?	0
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them ,  and if they fall ,  they dash themselves to pieces .	0
what satisfaction canst thou have to - night ?	0
indeed ,  he’s not right for this .	0
faith ,  the priest was good enough ,  for all the old gentleman’s saying .	0
this speed of caesar’s carries beyond belief .	0
where is the number of our english dead ?	0
how shall we then behold their natural tears ?	0
but if you don’t mean well ,  i beg you ,  madam !	0
it is offended.	0
what you’re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .	0
it’s well you offer it behind her back; the wish would other make a noisy house .	0
am i not stay'd for, cinna?	0
this is beyond words and beyond belief !	0
treason !	0
how long will a man lie in the earth before he rots?	0
they thus directed ,  we will follow in the main battle ,  whose puissance on either side shall be well wingèd with our chiefest horse .	0
come ,  come away .	0
will you withdraw?	0
she’s dead .	0
ay ,  madam ,  but returns again tonight .	0
i have them ready .	0
go pronounce his present death, and with his former title greet macbeth.	0
i used to love you .	0
i stand dishonored ,  that have gone about to link my dear friend to a common stale .	0
well ,  well .	0
either be patient and entreat me fair ,  or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations .	0
madam ,  i trust ,  not so .	0
by this sword ”  is an oath ,  and oaths must be kept .	0
and truly in my youth i suffered much extremity for love, very near this.	0
i would believe it against a fortuneteller.	0
you shall ,  mark antony .	0
ay .	0
really ?	0
oh ,  charmian ,  i will never leave this tomb !	0
this world doesn’t say yes, and it’s not strange at all that even our loves should change with our fortunes, because it’s a question we have to prove, when love leads fortune, or if fortune leads love.	0
listen ,  get going and ,  once and for all ,  stop following me !	0
how are you ,  sir ?	0
i accept with thanks ,  enobarbus .	0
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?	0
it is for the dead, not for the quick, therefore you lie.	0
shall caesar send a lie ?	0
o rejoice beyond a common joy!	0
would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia ?	0
when you do find him, or alive or dead, he’ll be found like brutus, like himself.	0
gentlemen !	0
i’ll think about what you’ve said; i’ll patiently hear what you’ve to say, and find a time when i can both meet with you to hear and answer such high things.	0
was that him just now ?	0
what’s she doing now ?	0
conceit upon her father.	0
what, ariel!	0
adieu.	0
why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.	0
it is not possible .	0
now must your conscience my acquittance seal ,  and you must put me in your heart for friend ,  sith you have heard ,  and with a knowing ear ,  that he which hath your noble father slain pursued my life .	0
post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced .	0
you’ll feel the loss, but not the loss of the friend you weep for.	0
how long has he been possessed like this ?	0
go; i'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.	0
for no man, sir.	0
put color in thy cheek .	0
this is thy negligence.	0
hail !	0
die two months ago, and not forgotten yet?	0
yes ,  my lord ,  and calfskin too .	0
is all our company here ?	0
go, tubal, and meet me at our synagogue; go, good tubal; at our synagogue, tubal.	0
and be not jealous on me ,  gentle brutus; were i a common laugher ,  or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester ,  if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them ,  or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout ,  then hold me dangerous .	0
never to speak of what you have heard ,  swear by my sword .	0
god knows i waited for you in anguish ,  pain ,  and agony when i gave birth to you .	0
no eyes in your head ,  nor no money in your purse ?	0
thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in brine ,  smarting in ling’ring pickle !	0
it is the poison'd cup; it is too late.	0
dearly ,  my delicate ariel .	0
i don’t know and he won’t tell me.	0
i, beyond all limit of whatever else in the world, do love, prize, honor you.	0
ha !	0
hear you aught of her in yours ?	0
truly then i fear you are damned both by father and mother .	0
peace ,  i say !	0
ay ,  sweet rosalind .	0
follow.	0
look ,  how he gets caesar’s attention .	0
will you have dinner there?	0
and so i thank you for your good counsel.	0
i’ll give you more instructions later .	0
in suicide ,  gods make the weak strong .	0
oh ,  in the duke of gloucester’s wallet .	0
but ,  o ,  what form of prayer can help me ?	0
we'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors.	0
but how will we keep it from being passed now ,  my lord ?	0
o ,  unpleasing news !	0
a worthy fool !	0
tell me ,  who had him arrested ?	0
with demetrius .	0
i think that one of them is still around here, and cannot make a getaway.	0
this will prove a brave kingdom to me, where i shall have my music for nothing.	0
may one be pardon'd and retain the offence ?	0
there’s a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the duke himself also ,  and your daughter .	0
the general and his wife are talking about it; and she strongly speaks up for you.	0
sinful macduff ,  they were killed because of you !	0
she did deceive her father ,  marrying you; and when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks ,  she loved them most .	0
well ,  keep me company for only two more years ,  and you’ll never know the sound of your own voice .	0
would they were clysterpipes for your sake!	0
if i die before you do make sure i’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .	0
indeed i’ll never be satisfied with romeo till i see him dead.	0
incapable and shallow innocents ,  you cannot guess who caused your father’s death .	0
deny me this, and an eternal curse fall on you!	0
why, no; the day had broke before we parted.	0
but for your husband ,  he is noble ,  wise ,  judicious ,  and best knows the fits o' th' season .	0
why, the honest men.	0
if after every tempest come such calms, may the winds blow till they have waken'd death!	0
if i had as many sons as i have hairs ,  i would not wish them to a fairer death .	0
oh ,  go ,  leave me .	0
no ,  indeed ,  my lord .	0
what kind of manners is it to go to a grave before your father?	0
come, how wouldst thou praise me?	0
a pair of stocks ,  you rogue !	0
he’ll release him .	0
o excellent !	0
all of them ?	0
what was the second noise for ?	0
my lady charged my duty in this business .	0
i have a rumor of fire ,  that i would gladly spread ,  before this news puts the fire out .	0
you both are rivals ,  and love hermia; and now both rivals ,  to mock helena .	0
ay, marry, is't; but to my mind, though i am native here and to the manner born, it is a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance.	0
come, merchant, have you any thing to say?	0
who’s calling me ?	0
a sail, a sail, a sail!	0
now ,  catesby ,  what says your lord to my request ?	0
gainst nature still !	0
i will hear cassius and compare their reasons, when severally we hear them rendered.	0
therefore ,  out of thy long - experienc'd time ,  give me some present counsel; or ,  behold ,  'twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire ,  arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring .	0
what do you say ,  james  well ,  i don’t know what to say .	0
hold ,  take thou that and that .	0
gracious king edward has sent us noble siward and ten thousand soldiers .	0
i do consent— prick him down, antony.	0
this, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me; and more above, hath his solicitings, as they fell out by time, by means, and place, all given to mine ear.	0
why did you leave wife and child in that rawness ,  those precious motives ,  those strong knots of love ,  without leave - taking ?	0
you can do whatever you want as long as it’s socially appropriate .	0
fie on't !	0
the armies have merely changed places ,  titinius ,  because octavius has been overthrown by noble brutus’s forces at the very moment that antony overthrew cassius’s legions .	0
and died so ?	0
i thought all for the best .	0
o ,  she will sing the savageness out of a bear .	0
come on ,  you’re being too hard on yourself .	0
drown cats and blind puppies .	0
those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .	0
be bold ,  and get ready .	0
spirit ,  we must prepare to meet with caliban .	0
stand!	0
heaven wanted rosalind to have these gifts and me to live and die as her slave .	0
o treacherous villains !	0
ay, if i be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating.	0
husband ,  let’s follow to see the end of this ado .	0
look ,  how he laughs already !	0
i am a villain .	0
answer; answer .	0
queen ,  you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you .	0
wife !	0
and whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .	0
my nyas ?	0
well ,  well .	0
tell me ,  my daughter juliet ,  what is your attitude about getting married ?	0
away!	0
that governs the torso and heart ,  doesn’t it ?	0
a was the first that ever bore arms.	0
let’s go ,  nerissa . —	0
ah sir !	0
holy saint francis !	0
as whence the sun ’gins his reflection shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break ,  so from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come discomfort swells .	0
an you'll come to supper tonight ,  you may; an you will not ,  come when you are next prepared for .	0
demetrius is a worthy gentleman .	0
you know i say nothing to him, because he doesn’t understand me, and i don’t understand him: he doesn’t know latin, french, or italian, and you will come into the court and swear that i only know a penny’s worth of english.	0
no, please, let it serve for dinner conversation; then, no matter what you say, i shall digest it with the other things i’m eating up.	0
if there’s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight ,  i won’t spend tonight in this town .	0
he did comply with his dug before he sucked it.	0
and my heart too.	0
i know you will say, “yes,” and i will take your word.	0
because if she is not honest, chaste, and true, there's no man happy; the purest of their wives is wicked as the leis about them.	0
no ,  it’s dreadfully steep .	0
go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.	0
yes ,  my lord .	0
my lord !	0
now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars when they laugh alone . — o romeo ,  that she were !	0
what shall i do ?	0
ready .	0
as young as i am ,  i have observed these three swashers .	0
madam ,  how are you liking this play ?	0
this island's mine ,  through sycorax my mother ,  which you took from me .	0
i'll fight, ’til from my bones my flesh be hack'd.	0
what do you think about the scottish lord ,  his neighbor ?	0
what performances have been prepared ?	0
they are his dung ,  and he their beetle .	0
he’s speaking now ,  or murmuring  “ where’s my serpent of old nile ?  ”  for so he calls me .	0
just know this before i begin: i can’t play a single note that’s worthy of note .	0
i think our country sinks beneath the yoke .	0
what antony shall speak ,  i will protest he speaks by leave and by permission ,  and that we are contented caesar shall have all true rites and lawful ceremonies .	0
no slander .	0
it’s pointless to talk now .	0
now please go in .	0
say ,  if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths ,  or from our masters ?	0
heartily farewell.	0
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die ,  like fire and powder ,  which ,  as they kiss ,  consume .	0
perhaps you have learned it without book .	0
let’s go ,  because it is after midnight ,  and ,  before day ,  we’ll wake him up ,  and be sure that he’s with us .	0
you’re asking me !	0
i have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner’s call is to keep her from sleeping—	0
i know you for what you really are ,  but as your sister i’m reluctant to criticize you .	0
my husband ?	0
there would this monster make a man .	0
come ,  katherine queen of all ,  reveal your heart to me in broken english .	0
do you intend to walk outside ?	0
do ,  do .	0
giving it back to him .	0
his love is blind and it suits the dark best .	0
look ,  sir ,  here comes the lady walking toward my cell .	0
women grow by men .	0
well ,  do your best .	0
i think it does.	0
when i left him ,  he was less than nine miles from here .	0
what are you there ?	0
he came to scatter flowers on his lady's grave, and asked me to stand off to the side, and so i did.	0
you say you don’t know what the girl thinks .	0
such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of kent’s banishment .	0
and cassius too .	0
will not king richard let me speak with him ?	0
if, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters into this fury by your magic, stop them.	0
your lord does know my mind .	0
ay ,  thou poor ghost ,  while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe .	0
well ,  that’s certainly out of this world ,  all right .	0
o ye gods ,  render me worthy of this noble wife !	0
o heart as black as death!	0
a very forward march - chick !	0
come ,  my dear love ,  the purchase made ,  the fruits are to ensue; that profit's yet to come 'tween me and you .	0
an honest guy who’s as poor as the king .	0
i little thought you would have followed .	0
do that ,  my friend .	0
it is but change ,  titinius ,  for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus' power ,  as cassius' legions are by antony .	0
her father loved me, oft invited me, still question'd me the story of my life from year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, that i have pass'd.	0
well ,  it must have been signior benedick .	0
if every one knows us ,  and we know none ,  'tis time ,  i think ,  to trudge ,  pack ,  and be gone .	0
good sentences, and well said.	0
carry this mad knave to the jail . —father baptista ,  i charge you see that he be forthcoming .	0
o, pardon me for bringing these ill news, since you did leave it for my office, sir.	0
are you riding far ?	0
go ,  bid the huntsmen wake them up by blowing the horns .	0
you too .	0
i pity your situation .	0
we all expect a gentle answer, jew.	0
it is my lady; o, it is my love!	0
why ,  so didst thou .	0
hark you ,  guildenstern ,  and you too—at each ear a hearer !	0
nothing but this: your true love for my master .	0
i'll be with you right away.	0
nay ,  in all confidence ,  he's not for rhodes .	0
how could he be in debt without me knowing it ?	0
give me a living reason she's disloyal.	0
i may not ,  madam .	0
be patient ,  because you’re staying with me .	0
your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions .	0
do, if it will not stand.	0
has there been such a time, i’d gladly know that, that i have positively said “it is so,” and it wasn’t?	0
god help thee ,  shallow man .	0
i must discontinue your company .	0
though we have spent our harvest of this king ,  we are to reap the harvest of his son .	0
o ,  my antonio !	0
lie they upon thy hand and be undone by ’em !	0
that's not true.	0
o romeo, romeo!	0
but ,  god be thanked ,  there is no need of me ,  and much i need to help you ,  were there need .	0
it probably has something to do with… i don’t know .	0
at supper ?	0
we will follow you .	0
madam ,  with all my heart .	0
he was furnished like a hunter .	0
by mary, sir, here's my intention:, and i believe it is a trick of protection.	0
weeping and wailing over tybalt's corpse.	0
fetch desdemona hither.	0
this tunis, sir, was carthage.	0
what soldiers ,  servant ?	0
help, ho!	0
he leads himself .	0
who are you ?	0
aside] poor worm !	0
we still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .	0
do not learn of him ,  emilia ,  though he be thy husband .	0
here ,  here ,  sir !	0
you don’t have reasonto say so .	0
i will not .	0
be merciful, say death; for exile has more terror in his look, much more than death; do not say banishment.	0
come to my woman's breasts, and take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers, wherever in your sightless substances you wait on nature's mischief!	0
i am too sore enpiercèd with his shaft to soar with his light feathers ,  and so bound ,  i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe .	0
better it were they all came by his father ,  or by the father there were none at all ,  for emulation who shall now be nearest will touch us all too near if god prevent not .	0
aren’t you embarrassed ?	0
so haply are they friends to antony .	0
caius ligarius doth bear caesar hard ,  who rated him for speaking well of pompey .	0
is the sword unswayed ?	0
a noise of thunder heard] [a noise of thunder heard] his spirits hear me ,  and yet i needs must curse .	0
thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to - night .	0
madam ,  so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars as i intend more good to you and yours than ever you or yours were by me harmed !	0
are you a man?	0
it must be self-offense.	0
if i live to see you married, i have my wish.	0
do you love me ?	0
if she should make tender of her love ,  ’tis very possible he’ll scorn it ,  for the man ,  as you know all ,  hath a contemptible spirit .	0
is not that he that lies upon the ground ?	0
your royal father's murdered .	0
amen .	0
what do you say ?	0
i embrace it freely, and will this brother's wager frankly play.— give us the foils.	0
nay ,  it is true ,  or else i am a turk .	0
let me be satisfied ,  is't good or bad ?	0
silver !	0
or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?	0
goodbye ,  brave moor; be kind to desdemona .	0
sweet desdemona!	0
a good wench; give it me .	0
an eagle ,  madam ,  hath not so green ,  so quick ,  so fair an eye as paris hath .	0
my lord ,  his throat is cut .	0
which one of you is the lady of the house ?	0
come ,  swear it ,  damn thyself; lest ,  being like one of heaven ,  the devils themselves should fear to seize thee .	0
gentlemen, can any of you tell me where i may find the young romeo?	0
i have been up this hour ,  awake all night .	0
she false with cassio?	0
you were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft enough to colour.	0
no ,  keep going ,  old man; don’t stop like that .	0
hark ,  she speaks !	0
to him in thine own voice ,  and bring me word how thou findest him .	0
who is she ?	0
give me your hand .	0
marry ,  for my part ,  i think the duke hath lost never a man ,  but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church ,  one bardolph ,  if your majesty know the man .	0
whichever of you acts shy ,  i’ll swear she has corns .	0
faith ,  i must; she'll rail i' the street else .	0
how tartly that gentleman looks !	0
can i go away while my heart stays here ?	0
do i ask you to follow me ?	0
i think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together .	0
what kept you from telling him this ?	0
can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?	0
if his face changed as much as his personality has ,  i wouldn’t recognize him .	0
cousins ,  i hope the days are near at hand that our homes will be safe .	0
ride ,  ride ,  messala .	0
ha ,  ha ,  ha !	0
o sir ,  you are old .	0
oh ,  come on . —come here ,  sir .	0
i have been in such a pickle since i saw you last that, i fear me, will never out of my bones.	0
well said, old mole!	0
they say ,  one taurus .	0
o slave!	0
he was an admirable king .	0
he was becoming very spirited when he was in school.	0
bring him my head .	0
art thou the slave that with thy breath hast killed mine innocent child ?	0
high and mighty ,  you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom .	0
is it my lady mother ?	0
but i’m still fairly high - ranking .	0
your wife would give you little thanks for that ,  if she were here to listen to such an offer .	0
to ferdinand] what is this maid with whom thou [to ferdinand] what is this maid with whom thou wast at play?	0
we just want you to answer to your real name .	0
ay ,  sir ,  for three months .	0
that's one of them .	0
ha ,  ha !	0
it is a good prophet that follows his own instructions; it’s easier for me to teach twenty people what was good to do than to be one of that twenty and follow my own teaching .	0
so young ,  my lord ,  and honest .	0
and what hope is that ,  please ?	0
i’ve got some business to take care of .	0
well ,  to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .	0
three thousand dollars  -  i think i may take his promise to pay .	0
god have mercy on his soul!	0
his liberty is full of threats to all, to you yourself, to us, to every one.	0
how does your honor?	0
that’s foolish .	0
please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions .	0
i don’t have a talent for putting my heart’s feelings into words .	0
stand!	0
well too .	0
i was never cursed; i have no gift at all in being a fighter; i am a right maid for my cowardice; don’t let her strike me .	0
from all such devils ,  good lord ,  deliver us !	0
you know that the night hides my face; otherwise, a maiden’s blush would paint my cheek for what you overheard me say tonight.	0
nothing is what it is .	0
i swear ,  before i die i’m going to see you sick with love .	0
thou hast harped my fear aright .	0
this is not brutus, friend, but, i assure you, a prize no less in worth.	0
that’s how sound a man you appeared .	0
sir, octavius is already come to rome.	0
let’s go inside and we’ll answer all your questions truthfully .	0
sit down; for thou must now know farther .	0
those that are married already ,  all but one ,  shall live ,  the rest stay the same .	0
where are you going ?	0
didst thou see any thing ?	0
cesario is your servant’s name ,  fair princess .	0
get me ink and paper and hire posthorses.	0
with a web as little as this ,  i’ll catch as big a fly as cassio .	0
o most courageous day !	0
signior montano ,  your trusty and very valiant servant ,  salutes you like this ,  with his free duty ,  and begs you to believe him .	0
that death's unnatural that kills for loving .	0
aside .	0
but macbeth is .	0
haven’t you got enough love to be patient with me, when that sudden mood which my mother gave me makes me forgetful?	0
he’s welcome too.	0
hail !	0
it was not brought me ,  my lord .	0
sister ,  you’ll go with us ?	0
stand not amazed .	0
dorset is fled to richmond .	0
i did .	0
she's dead ,  deceased !	0
many hot inroads they make in italy—the borders maritime lack blood to think on ’t—and flush youth revolt .	0
i really hope your virtues will bring him to his usual way again ,  to the honor of both of you .	0
i won’t betray them .	0
if your majesties recall it ,  the welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing ,  wearing leeks in their monmouth caps which ,  your majesty knows ,  is to this day a badge of honorable military service .	0
and be not jealous on me, gentle brutus; were i a common laugher, or did use to stale with ordinary oaths my love to every new protester, if you know that i do fawn on men and hug them hard and after scandal them, or if you know that i profess myself in banqueting to all the rout, then hold me dangerous.	0
it is a good divine that follows his own instructions: i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching.	0
come on ,   “ nothing ”  will get you nothing .	0
in fact ,  the real nightmare had only just begun .	0
who is't you mean?	0
i’m sure it would’ve, i’m sure it would’ve.	0
ay ,  ay ,  the cords .	0
goodbye, good strato.	0
here's romeo's man.	0
he is the prince of horses .	0
alas ,  poor hurt fowl ,  now will he creep into sedges .	0
forth of my heart those charms ,  thine eyes ,  are blotted; thy bed ,  lust - stain'd shall with lust's blood be spotted .	0
ding ,  dong ,  bell .	0
you told us of some suit.	0
with mine officer!	0
goblin ,  lead them up and down .	0
but first i’ll release the fairy queen from the spell .	0
why, in good time.	0
i’m about to fly away .	0
fairies ,  be gone ,  and be all ways away .	0
she is worse than wicked .	0
is this the madman ?	0
and may you prove ,  sir ,  master of your art .	0
and like i am for rosalind .	0
but, indeed, if you don’t find him within this month, you will smell him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.	0
believe me ,  no .	0
oh ,  pardon me for bringing this bad news ,  but you told me it was my job ,  sir .	0
where is lysander and fair hermia?	0
it was a rough night .	0
methought i was, and methought i had, but man is but a patched fool, if he will offer to say what methought i had.	0
you shall not seal to such a bond for me; i'll rather dwell in my necessity .	0
i’ll go alone .	0
no; you will reveal it.	0
there is means ,  madam .	0
alack ,  my lord ,  that fault is none of yours .	0
i answered that lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .	0
bestow it at your pleasure ,  and believe caesar’s no merchant ,  to make prize with you of things that merchants sold .	0
the brave experience death only once .	0
the same indeed; a very valiant fellow.	0
marry ,  well said ,  very well said .	0
here ,  my good lord .	0
what did thy song bode ,  lady ?	0
by your patience, i needs must rest me.	0
one bit of land will be a pillow for us both; one heart ,  one bed ,  two bosoms ,  and one trust .	0
here's cassio hurt by villains .	0
for your dwelling, briefly.	0
cobweb .	0
signior lodovico?	0
in what chapter and verse of his heart ?	0
let them go .	0
by your patience ,  i may not suffer you to visit them .	0
here, under leave of brutus and the rest— for brutus is an honorable man; so are they all, all honorable men— come i to speak in caesar's funeral.	0
then there must be no lovers in the forest ,  either ,  because they’re as good as a clock ,  marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour .	0
listen ,  but speak not to't .	0
go fetch my best attires .	0
let’s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner .	0
bernardo?	0
retire thee ,  go where thou art billeted .	0
what good could they pretend?	0
and now ,  good friends ,  as you are friends ,  scholars and soldiers ,  give me one poor request .	0
good ursula ,  go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .	0
i hope god keeps that monster from growing in othello’s mind !	0
it’s good if you love hero ,  because she’s worthy of your love .	0
couple it with something; make it a word and a blow .	0
why ,  thou say’st true .	0
do you think it is this ?	0
isn’t that he who lies on the ground ?	0
and if tomorrow our navy thrive ,  i have an absolute hope our landmen will stand up .	0
what said he?	0
this is old ninny's tomb.	0
well, well, jealous oberon!	0
the night’s too rough for humans to bear .	0
the ship was under sail .	0
i think it be no other but e'en so .	0
o heart ,  don’t give up now ,  don’t ever let the soul of nero ,  the crazy emperor ,  enter this determined heart .	0
romeo ,  will you come to your father's ?	0
suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.	0
this is no place ,  this house is but a butchery .	0
in most profound earnest ,  and ,  i’ll warrant you ,  for the love of beatrice .	0
i am th' unhappy subject of these quarrels .	0
that is my rest; that is the rendezvous of it .	0
some good i mean to do despite of mine own nature .	0
most rightful judge !	0
and therefore as a stranger give it welcome .	0
who tricked you ?	0
look you ,  here she comes !	0
unpunished !	0
i speak not to disprove what brutus spoke ,  but here i am to speak what i do know .	0
many of you own slaves ,  which—like your donkeys and dogs and mules—you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them .	0
all the rumors have been confirmed .	0
i’m that great gust to her fire .	0
ay ,  sir ,  but 'while the grass grows'—the proverb is something musty .	0
we’re ready if our minds are ready .	0
in happy time .	0
macbeth !	0
tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world ,  and has nothing to do with her property .	0
with who ?	0
and her sister’s dead too ,  poisoned by your wife .	0
by which honor i dare not swear thou lovest me ,  yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost ,  notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage .	0
nay ,  but i bar tonight .	0
as she is mine ,  i may dispose of her— which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death—according to our law immediately provided in that case .	0
tranio hits you now .	0
alas ,  iago ,  my lord hath so bewhored her ,  thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her ,  as true hearts cannot bear .	0
that was too much .	0
romeo's a dishclout to him .	0
tybalt ,  the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting .	0
goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !	0
ready .	0
what is the name of the castle that stands over there ?	0
if this be so ,  why blame you me to love you ?	0
last thing he did ,  dear queen ,  he kissed—the last of many doubled kisses— this orient pearl .	0
no ,  no !	0
the very place puts desperate ideas, without any motive, into every brain that looks so many fathoms into the sea and hears it roar beneath.	0
goblin ,  lead them up and down .	0
who offered him the crown ?	0
adieu .	0
say on; come to hecuba .	0
nay, i know not.	0
no ,  my dear ,  you were a little angel who kept me going .	0
you evil whore !	0
o ,  i have lost my reputation !	0
well, juliet, i will lie with thee to-night.	0
what ,  to kiss in private ?	0
i can’t love him .	0
would i were sleep and peace ,  so sweet to rest !	0
and ,  good lieutenant ,  i think you think i love you .	0
why ,  he was met even now as mad as the vexed sea ,  singing aloud ,  crowned with rank fumiter and furrow - weeds ,  with burdocks ,  hemlock ,  nettles ,  cuckoo - flowers ,  darnel ,  and all the idle weeds that grow in our sustaining corn . —a century send forth .	0
do you mark that ?	0
then the whining schoolboy with his satchel and shining morning face ,  creeping like snail unwillingly to school .	0
of this my letters before did satisfy you .	0
edgar i nothing am .	0
mercy on us ! ’—‘we split ,  we split ! ’—‘farewell ,  my wife and children ! ’—‘farewell ,  brother ! ’—‘we split ,  we split ,  we split ! ’ let's all sink wi'th’ king .	0
good roaring ,  lion !	0
some aqua - vitae ,  ho !	0
who lies i' th' second chamber ?	0
sit thee down ,  clitus .	0
what do you mean ,  my lord ?	0
and where’s cordelia ? — seest thou this object ,  kent ?	0
the weather is fair .	0
go to your tomb !	0
i have marked a thousand blushing apparitions to start into her face ,  a thousand innocent shames in angel whiteness beat away those blushes ,  and in her eye there hath appeared a fire to burn the errors that these princes hold against her maiden truth .	0
you call yourself my wife ,  yet you don’t call me  “ husband ”  ?	0
be patient ,  because the prize i’m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now .	0
here was a caesar !	0
me too ,  i swear .	0
what bastard doth not?	0
now, tybalt, take back again the word “villain” that you just gave me; for mercutio's soul is only a little way above our heads, waiting for yours to keep him company.	0
a man ,  sir .	0
the jew shall have my flesh ,  blood ,  bones ,  and all ,  ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood .	0
ass ,  i doubt not .	0
it’s true ,  my lords ,  he did .	0
then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .	0
why are they shouting ?	0
i am at your service .	0
and now titania and oberon can never meet in the grove or on green ,  by a clear fountain ,  or spangled shiny starlight ,  but they refuse to settle the issue ,  so that all their elves creep into acorn cups ,  and hide them there ,  because they’re so frightened .	0
of course ,  they won’t believe you without proof .	0
this rudeness is the topping to his good traits, which lets men accept his words with better understanding.	0
i am sure he had more hair of his tail than i have of my face when i last saw him .	0
call up the right master constable .	0
in terms of choice, i am not only led by the nice direction of a maiden's eyes; besides, the lottery of my destiny doesn’t give me the right to choose voluntarily; but, if my father had not restricted me and controlled me by his wit, to give myself as his wife to the one who wins me by that means i told you, you yourself, renowned prince, would then stand as fair as any other man i have looked on yet for my affection.	0
ready to go ,  but never to return .	0
oh ,  that the slave had forty thousand lives !	0
be thrifty .	0
clearly ,  men should not go out walking too late !	0
well ,  all of these should be in the lantern ,  because they’re all in the moon .	0
uncle, this is a montague, our foe; a villain, that is hither come in spite to scorn at our solemnity this night.	0
i’d rather be anything besides a fool .	0
pray you, tell me this; if he should break his day, what should i gain by the exaction of the forfeiture?	0
tell me ,  fluellen: did you just come from the bridge ?	0
you peasant swain !	0
therefore my son is embedded in the ooze; and i'll seek him deeper than a piece of lead ever measured how deep the water is, and i will lie there with him in the mud.	0
your mind is tossing on the ocean; there, where your argosies, with portly sail,— like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,— do overpeer the petty traffickers, that curt'sy to them, do them reverence, as they fly by them with their woven wings.	0
monster ,  your fairy ,  which you say is a harmless fairy ,  has done little better than played us for fools .	0
as ignorant as dirt!	0
why ,  how are you ,  general !	0
i knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit .	0
calling death banishment ,  you cut my head off with a golden axe ,  and smile on the stroke that murders me .	0
your part in her you could not keep from death ,  but heaven keeps his part in eternal life .	0
what kind of hands are these?	0
not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh jew, thou mak'st thy knife keen; but no metal can, no, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness of thy sharp envy.	0
caesar ,  you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .	0
please't your highness to grace us with your royal company ?	0
this is a trick to distract me from my request .	0
i heard nothing.	0
no ,  i warrant your grace you shall not entreat him to a second ,  that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .	0
when the barrel’s empty ,  we’ll drink water .	0
o night, which ever art when day is not!	0
why, that’s the coroner’s finding.	0
tell us where it is, that we may take it from there, and carry it to the chapel.	0
goodbye ,  my lord .	0
well ,  do what you want .	0
he’s a proper count ,  that count sugarplum ,  a sweet gentleman ,  for sure !	0
they laugh that win .	0
stay, gentle helena; hear my excuse; my love, my life, my soul, fair helena!	0
o me !	0
the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake .	0
but i still believe the source and beginning of his grief began with rejected love.	0
wouldst thou aught with me ?	0
o wife, look how our daughter bleeds!	0
then she is well, and nothing can be wrong.	0
mark antony in egypt sits at dinner ,  and will make no wars without doors .	0
if i ever come back ,  i’ll bring you good news .	0
we will speak further.	0
o, are you here, iago?	0
what ,  you want them to weep our horses' blood ?	0
i’ll go to him .	0
i am glad on ’t .	0
touching our person ,  seek we no revenge ,  but we our kingdom’s safety must so tender ,  whose ruin you have sought ,  that to her laws we do deliver you .	0
here he comes with captain jamy ,  the scots captain .	0
this is the woman ,  but not this the man .	0
and ,  i beg you ,  twist the law once to your authority; to do a great right ,  do a little wrong ,  and deprive this cruel devil of his will .	0
his eyes were as green as leeks .	0
curse you all ,  you’re all murderers and traitors !	0
is he well shipped ?	0
o, he is crazy, laertes.	0
lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe .	0
apollo flies ,  and daphne chases him; the dove pursues the vulture; the mild deer runs faster to catch the tiger — helpless speed ,  when cowardice chases and courage flies .	0
who’s there ?	0
my trusty servant ,  ariel !	0
we will have more of this tomorrow .	0
by janus ,  i think no .	0
to her ,  widow !	0
what will you do?	0
no more than i do yours .	0
confess ,  and love ,  had been the very sum of my confession: o happy torment ,  when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance !	0
please, sir, stand up; i am sure you are not launcelot, my boy.	0
as a friend or an enemy?	0
not for thy fairy kingdom .	0
i think it’s later than that ,  sir .	0
when we shall meet at compt ,  this look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven ,  and fiends will snatch at it .	0
wherefore are these things hid ?	0
my sword is drawn .	0
give room !	0
if e'er the jew her father come to heaven, it will be for his gentle daughter's sake: and never dare misfortune cross her foot, unless she do it under this excuse,— that she is issue to a faithless jew.	0
you are a counsellor; if you can command these elements to silence ,  and work the peace of the present ,  we will not hand a rope more; use your authority .	0
good margaret ,  run thee to the parlor .	0
you shall be a woodmonger and buy nothing of me but cudgels .	0
we will haste us .	0
are these things spoken ,  or do i but dream ?	0
i was a gentleman ,  and then i told you true .	0
swaggering ?	0
if he be so resolved ,  i can o'ersway him .	0
my language!	0
by my troth ,  nerissa ,  my little body is a - weary of this great world .	0
it’s not daylight .	0
if there are any, speak, because i offended him.	0
this is the end of my journey ,  the end of my life .	0
i hate your logic as much as i hate an empty drinking cup .	0
virtue itself turns vice ,  being misapplied ,  and vice sometime by action dignified .	0
the third o’ th’ world is yours ,  which with a snaffle you may pace easy ,  but not such a wife .	0
i would fain prove so .	0
now ,  my lord .	0
hold off the earth awhile, till i have caught her once more in mine arms.	0
he exposed edgar’s murderous plot ,  and was wounded ,  as you see there ,  when trying to apprehend him .	0
regan ,  i think you are .	0
give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell .	0
that we must do that also.	0
made you my guardians ,  my depositaries ,  but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number .	0
both, both, my girl.	0
i won’t be afraid of blow flies .	0
killing swine .	0
what meanest thou by that ,  malvolio ?	0
what have you done ?	0
on what grounds ?	0
it seems to me like we’re still sleeping ,  still dreaming .	0
but if i were brutus, and if brutus were antony, there would be an antony to ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue in every wound of caesar, that would move the stones of rome to rise and rebel.	0
i’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .	0
sure ,  but don’t do it at full volume until there’s no danger in it .	0
how shall i murder him ,  iago ?	0
god save you, worthy general!	0
it was a good and lucky vision .	0
you have quarreled with a man for coughing in the street, because he woke up your dog that was asleep in the sun.	0
i had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.	0
hass the storm blown over ?	0
it’s true ,  he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .	0
but i'll set down the pegs that make this music ,  as honest as i am .	0
i can ,  petruchio ,  help thee to a wife with wealth enough ,  and young and beauteous ,  brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman .	0
there were twenty montagues fighting in this awful riot ,  and together those twenty could only kill one man .	0
that’s it ?	0
and if you could ,  you couldn’t bring him back to life .	0
it is but change, titinius, for octavius is overthrown by noble brutus' power, as cassius' legions are by antony.	0
bad news ,  my lord .	0
it never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know .	0
peace then ,  no words .	0
let’s get started right away .	0
what is thy name?	0
i’ll remember .	0
you’re the ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times.	0
yes ,  i’ve been responsible for his upbringing .	0
follow me .	0
come, for england!	0
fair sir ,  and you ,  my merry mistress ,  that with your strange encounter much amazed me ,  my name is called vincentio ,  my dwelling pisa ,  and bound i am to padua ,  there to visit a son of mine which long i have not seen .	0
there's no offence, my lord.	0
the same to you ,  my lord !	0
i have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed .	0
alack ,  alack !	0
don’t bring me any more reports .	0
hail ,  caesar !	0
the only thing different about me is my clothes .	0
come in ,  without there !	0
he was the first that ever bore arms.	0
then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?	0
well ,  at least that’s something .	0
your husband knew it all.	0
if you leave like that ,  you tell the world that it’s not worthy of a good - bye .	0
come out of your sockets ,  eyes !	0
name the day of marriage ,  and god give thee joy .	0
so i thank you all ,  and i invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of scotland at scone .	0
women are made to bear ,  and so are you .	0
all but metellus cimber ,  and he’s gone to seek you at your house .	0
o heavy burden !	0
and yet you will teach me to avoid quarrelling?!	0
aside .	0
one ,  sir ,  that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will .	0
she’s desperate .	0
stand you directly in antonio's way ,  when he doth run his course .	0
which i made of the bark of a tree ,  with my own hands ,  since i was cast ashore .	0
i am very sorry that you are not well .	0
caesar is listening .	0
a great suspicion!	0
here comes my man.	0
mark antony is at dinner in egypt and won’t be going outside to make war .	0
if love be blind ,  love cannot hit the mark .	0
he won’t listen to anyone’s advice .	0
i’m not like that now .	0
he looks skinny ,  like a dried herring without its eggs ,  and he hasn’t got his girl .	0
for now ,  don’t try to persuade me anymore—i ask you as a friend .	0
let me not stay a jot for dinner .	0
this messenger is wise .	0
to answer that ,  i should confess to you .	0
that’s not good ,  and no good can come of it either .	0
mr. antonio send you his regards.	0
go ahead..	0
remember that hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .	0
you have a good ear .	0
i have lived long enough.	0
not having the thing that would make them short hours .	0
thou hast my love .	0
think on me ,  that am with phoebus’ amorous pinches black and wrinkled deep in time .	0
alas the heavy day !	0
i don’t have a lord .	0
o most dear mistress, the sun will set before i finish what i must work to do.	0
of princes in this number and nobles bearing banners ,  there lie dead one hundred twenty - six .	0
some true love turned false must follow because of your mistake ,  and not a false love turned true .	0
all may be well .	0
get going!	0
there ,  give it to your whore .	0
go to; say no more .	0
yes ,  madam ,  only to return again tonight .	0
and i’ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .	0
pardon not that .	0
in such a night ,  did thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew ,  and saw the lion's shadow ere himself ,  and ran dismay'd away .	0
give me my amour .	0
speakest thou from thy heart ?	0
those are the raisèd father and his friends .	0
this heavy - headed revel east and west makes us traduced and taxed of other nations .	0
yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.	0
your looks are pale and wild ,  and do import some misadventure .	0
what though he love your hermia ?	0
you have often started to tell me who i am, but you stopped, and left me to a useless questioning, concluding “wait, not yet.” now it’s time, the very minute asks you to listen carefully; obey and listen.	0
false face must hide what the false heart doth know .	0
villainy ,  villainy ,  villainy !	0
deny me this ,  and an eternal curse fall on you !	0
i protest ,  in the sincerity of love and honest kindness .	0
no ,  i think there’s more to this than you’re letting on .	0
every one .	0
orsino .	0
i had only one child ,  one poor child ,  one poor and loving child ,  the one thing i had to rejoice and comfort myself ,  and cruel death has stolen it from me !	0
i dare abide no longer .	0
macbeth has come .	0
he would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech; make mad the guilty and appal the free, confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed the very faculties of eyes and ears.	0
good morning ,  gentlemen .	0
some achieve greatness— ”  what are you saying ?	0
this was well done ,  my bird .	0
what horrible fancy's this ?	0
i can’t find it .	0
as thick as tale can post with post ,  and every one did bear thy praises in his kingdom’s great defense ,  and poured them down before him .	0
a woman more beautiful than the one i love ?	0
you can’t do that .	0
hail to you ,  baron of glamis !	0
do you have news from verona ! —what is it ,  balthasar ?	0
the world is not thy friend nor the world’s law .	0
sweet beatrice ,  wouldst thou come when i called thee ?	0
las ,  what's the matter ?	0
do as i bid thee ,  go .	0
but i didn’t want to be free like this .	0
my happiness and yours lie in her .	0
old cassius still !	0
all's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.	0
i took him to be killed with a thunder - stroke .	0
why ,  what a complicated case this is !	0
in happy time.	0
nay ,  guiltiness will speak ,  though tongues were out of use .	0
come you to make confession to this father ?	0
go back again and be new beaten home ?	0
i'll follow ,  stephano .	0
i don’t trust you .	0
it was most terrible to hear .	0
rome ,  there are no more people of noble bloods in you !	0
sit down, clitus.	0
the second cock hath crow'd, the curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.	0
just tell me .	0
a two - hundred - year - old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .	0
he was graced with lots of natural gifts ,  he was young ,  valiant ,  wise ,  and no doubt meant to be king .	0
what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?	0
what’s this all about ?	0
how looked he ?	0
why should you fall into so deep an o ?	0
i bet she’ll chew him out .	0
don’t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this ,  out of duty and love ?	0
this is the man .	0
how cheer'st thou, jessica?	0
your words ,  like your wounds ,  bring you honor .	0
nature took helen’s  cleopatra’s majesty ,  the best of atalanta ,  and unhappy lucretia’s modesty .	0
oh ,  sir ,  on her nose ,  which is covered with pimples ,  sores ,  and red welts .	0
please save me a piece of marzipan; and because you love me, let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell.	0
how is the queen?	0
authority .	0
o, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!	0
one word more ,  good lady .	0
i will read it.	0
is antony or we in fault for this ?	0
satan ,  avoid !	0
here comes my lord .	0
give me the cups; and let the kettle to the trumpet speak ,  the trumpet to the cannoneer without ,  the cannons to the heavens ,  the heaven to earth ,  ‘now the king drinks to hamlet . ’ come ,  begin .	0
what then?	0
they are all welcome.	0
no ,  it is casca ,  one incorporate to our attempts .	0
go on ,  get out of here .	0
you don’t need eyes to see how the world works .	0
think ,  my lord ?	0
what, shall i groan and tell you?	0
shall i deny you ?	0
charles did the same to the second brother ,  and the third .	0
swear ?	0
gonzalo is a miracle - worker .	0
age ,  thou art shamed !	0
this is a slight ,  unmeritable man ,  meet to be sent on errands .	0
draw your sword ,  you jerk !	0
to visit you, my lord; no other occasion.	0
no ,  cassius ,  no .	0
you don’t know whether it was his wisdom or his fear.	0
i think i can discover him ,  if you please to get good guard and go along with me .	0
oh ,  i followed that i blush to look upon !	0
no ,  i’ve had my say .	0
the will !	0
is clarence dead ?	0
we’ll have to speak more .	0
of that i shall have also cause to speak, and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.	0
o ,  what other favor can i do for you than to end the youth of your enemy with the same hand that cut your youth half ?	0
for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard ,  and is to come again .	0
for all the rest ,  let lion ,  moonshine ,  wall ,  and lovers twain ,  at large discourse while here they do remain .	0
i’ll come too .	0
lay off ,  already !	0
ay .	0
many good morrows to my noble lord .	0
o true ,  good catesby .	0
here comes the good macduff .	0
then i’ll tell you .	0
then put up your pipes in your bag ,  for i’ll away .	0
we'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings— i ha't !	0
it shall be done ,  my lord .	0
my dear lord ,  you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .	0
follow me if you’re brave enough ,  and we’ll fight over helena .	0
the time is so out of whack .	0
nor time nor place did then adhere ,  and yet you would make both: they have made themselves ,  and that their fitness now does unmake you .	0
or of a courtier ,  which could say 'good morrow ,  sweet lord !	0
sebastian was my father’s name ,  and my brother was named sebastian too .	0
tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit; for i am sick when i do look on thee .	0
give me your hand .	0
most veritable ,  therefore look to ’t well .	0
may good luck follow you !	0
if you’ll take a simple man’s advice ,  don’t be here when it arrives .	0
leave us alone for a little while.	0
didst perceive?	0
show me the place .	0
it would anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress' circle, of some strange nature, letting it stand there until she had laid it down, and conjured it down.	0
what mean you ,  sir ?	0
for gazing on your beams ,  fair sun ,  being by .	0
how say you by the french lord, monsieur le bon?	0
judge, o you gods, how dearly caesar loved him!	0
listen ,  but don’t speak to it .	0
the generals want to speak with us .	0
i will not take her on gift of any man .	0
that’s claudio .	0
i have often led you ,  now you must carry me ,  my good friends—and take my thanks for everything .	0
so do not i .	0
consent to pay thee that i never had ? — arrest me ,  foolish fellow ,  if thou dar’st .	0
write them together ,  yours is as fair a name .	0
to sebastian and antonio] there stand ,  [to sebastian and antonio] there stand ,  for you are spell - stopped . — holy gonzalo ,  honourable man ,  mine eyes ,  even sociable to the show of thine ,  fall fellowly drops .	0
i like it too .	0
how is it, brother?	0
i hear horses .	0
here ,  sir !	0
come on, let’s get going!	0
well, keep me company for only two more years, and you’ll never know the sound of your own voice.	0
has it come to this ?	0
do not ,  phoebe .	0
you’re not going ,  sir .	0
hey ,  hey !	0
sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him; and go, sir paris.	0
true ,  ”  said she ,   “ a fine little one .  ”   “ no ,  ”  said i ,   “ a great wit .  ”   “ right ,  ”  says she ,   “ a great gross one .  ”   “ nay ,  ”  said i ,   “ a good wit .  ”   “ just ,  ”  said she ,   “ it hurts nobody .  ”   “ nay ,  ”  said i ,   “ the gentleman is wise .  ”   “ certain ,  ”  said she ,   “ a wise gentleman .  ”   “ nay ,  ”  said i ,   “ he hath the tongues .  ”   “ that i believe ,  ”  said she ,   “ for he swore a thing to me on monday night ,  which he forswore on tuesday morning; there’s a double tongue ,  there’s two tongues .  ”  thus did she an hour together transshape thy particular virtues .	0
i am calm, sir.	0
he lost both ,  my lord . —ma'am ,  this letter is from your sister ,  and needs an immediate answer .	0
if such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft, which now again you are most apt to play the sir in.	0
here ,  thou incestuous ,  murderous ,  damnèd dane ,  drink off this potion .	0
well too .	0
twas a sweet marriage ,  and we prosper well in our return .	0
sad hours seem long .	0
doctor, the thanes fly from me.	0
the last time i was in exeter ,  the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it  “  my lord !	0
you were given birth by a woman .	0
i love not to see wretchedness o'er - charged ,  and duty in his service perishing .	0
this tyrant ,  whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it ,  was once considered an honest man .	0
brave son ,  fathered from honorable loins !	0
in suicide ,  gods allow tyrants to be defeated .	0
order him to advance his forces first thing ,  and we’ll follow .	0
i’ve got a plan that will fix everything .	0
how do you ,  pretty lady ?	0
do you know why the king of france suddenly went back home ?	0
we will ,  we will .	0
the fold stands empty in the drownèd field ,  and crows are fatted with the murrain flock .	0
i don’t believe it .	0
it’s the same with men .	0
but this is a little thing; and it seeks to hide itself all the more, it shows how big it is.	0
don’t talk to me ,  because i won’t say a word .	0
so stop hoping and wondering what i mean .	0
don’t you have any manners ,  you savage ?	0
call the messengers !	0
stand up .	0
where is that moron of a cook ?	0
here lies the east .	0
i hope to god we can make him happy and do him some good !	0
keep quiet ,  keep quiet .	0
welcome ,  gentle day !	0
let her know ’t . —   and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities .	0
i would have made it short ,  for i was come to the whole depth of my tale ,  and meant ,  indeed ,  to occupy the argument no longer .	0
the morning is coming.	0
we ,  hermia ,  like two artificial gods ,  have with our needles created both one flower ,  both on one sampler ,  sitting on one cushion ,  both warbling of one song ,  both in one key; as if our hands ,  our sides ,  voices ,  and minds ,  had been incorporate .	0
we’ll burn the house of brutus .	0
the people love me ,  and the sea is mine .	0
thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword i'll prove the lie thou speak'st.	0
i only speak right on .	0
i’ve destroyed my reputation ,  a most shameful error .	0
in happy time .	0
by my heel, i care not.	0
i did it while he was sleeping , —that is finished too , — and the athenian woman by his side ,  so that ,  when he woke up ,  she must ,  of course ,  be the first he saw .	0
go prick your face and hide your fear in a red face, you lily-livered boy.	0
you have known what you should not.	0
i’m no ordinary fairy .	0
another general shout !	0
yes ,  if you kept them together and invested them .	0
true; and a goose for his discretion .	0
fly further off ,  my lord ,  fly further off; mark antony is in your tents ,  my lord; fly ,  therefore ,  noble cassius ,  fly far off .	0
your brother is but young and tender ,  and ,  for your love i would be loath to foil him ,  as i must for my own honor if he come in .	0
alas ,  poor yorick !	0
then i have offended no one .	0
go !	0
if it will not be ,  i’ll leave you .	0
what are his words ?	0
my good king ,  surprise the english and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .	0
where did you get that cowardly look ?	0
i must take out the embroidery ?	0
tis certain so ,  the prince woos for himself .	0
tell me the truth.	0
alas ,  who knows ?	0
hark thee ,  clitus .	0
o you mighty gods ,   this world i do renounce ,  and in your sights shake patiently my great affliction off .	0
and my king goes on: if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands ,  henry’s artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of france shall echo your mocking of him back in your face .	0
and ,  for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorred commands ,  refusing her grand hests ,  she did confine thee ,  by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage ,  into a cloven pine ,  within which rift imprisoned thou didst painfully remain a dozen years; within which space she died and left thee there ,  where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as mill wheels strike .	0
and this may help to support other proofs that look questionable .	0
thou art a traitor— off with his head .	0
harder ,  harder .	0
but fare ye well .	0
now the condition.	0
since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet in thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.	0
no ,  just to the gates of hell ,  where the devil will meet me ,  with the horns on his head like a cuckold ,  and say ,   “ go up to heaven ,  beatrice .	0
i entreat you both that, being of so young days brought up with him, and sith so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour, that you vouchsafe your rest here in our court some little time; so by your companies to draw him on to pleasures, and to gather so much as from occasion you may glean, whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus that open'd lies within our remedy.	0
romans ,  countrymen ,  and friends !	0
heaven is here, where juliet lives; and every cat and dog and little mouse, every unworthy thing, live here in heaven and may look on her; but romeo may not.	0
i will frown as i pass by ,  and let them take it as they list .	0
jove’s lightning ,  the precursors o' th' dreadful thunderclaps ,  more momentary and sight - outrunning were not .	0
faith, here's an english tailor come hither, for stealing out of a french hose.	0
on a night like this ,  young lorenzo swore he loved her very much ,  stealing her heart with vows of love ,  but not one vow was true .	0
it were well the general were put in mind of it .	0
out, out, thou strumpet, fortune!	0
oh ,  she is lame !	0
tedious ”  and  “ brief ”  ?	0
either charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .	0
now might i do it pat .	0
if you respect my will, then show a fair presence and put off these frowns, they are not the proper expressions for a feast.	0
farewell .	0
a good fool .	0
come on .	0
then i will kiss your lips ,  kate .	0
what if she won’t kiss me ?	0
the pale companion is not for our pomp .	0
so will you confess, i am sure, that you love me.	0
we’ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords ,  then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room .	0
nobody marks you .	0
if you want things done in the right way ,  you’ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .	0
hast thou not a word of joy?	0
help, help!	0
i am glad of it .	0
i'll make so bold to call, for ’tis my limited service.	0
endless weeping for your cousin's death?	0
is the king coming, i beg you?	0
indeed ,  indeed ,  sirs ,  but this troubles me .	0
ay ,  the heads of the maids ,  or their maidenheads .	0
look ,  my gentle love is awakened !	0
no i won’t ,  even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .	0
large and increasing .	0
but i ,  who have never known how to beg and never had to beg ,  am starved for food ,  dizzy with lack of sleep ,  kept awake with curses and fed with brawling .	0
tis neither here nor there .	0
awake ,  awake !	0
what kind of woman is’t ?	0
but yet you draw not iron ,  for my heart is true as steel .	0
go inside yourself .	0
here comes one .	0
and as i say ,  retire with me to my lodging ,  from whence i will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak .	0
listen to this ,  king: as soon as we sent those irish soldiers running for cover ,  the norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons .	0
oh ,  my heart bleeds to think o' th' teen that i have turned you to ,  which is from my remembrance !	0
he can’t bear his grief and so he’s losing his mind .	0
behold !	0
man is but an ass if he go about to expound this methought i was—there is no man can tell what dream.	0
captain jamy is a marvelous falorous gentleman ,  that is certain ,  and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchient wars ,  upon my particular knowledge of his directions .	0
i'll  “ re ”  you ,  i'll  “ fa ”  you .	0
why have you left the chamber?	0
get out of my sight ! —dear cesario ,  please don’t be offended . —get out of here ,  you barbarian !	0
tide life ,  'tide death ,  i come without delay .	0
love ,  therefore ,  and tongue - tied simplicity in least speak most ,  to my capacity .	0
it shall be call'd ‘bottom's dream,’ because it hath no bottom; and i will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the duke.	0
well done !	0
so .	0
inquire the jew's house out ,  give him this deed ,  and let him sign it; we'll away to - night ,  and be a day before our husbands home .	0
when you find out who started this disagreement ,  turn your anger upon them .	0
o god ,  she comes . —o honey nurse ,  what news ?	0
but wasn’t this near the shore?	0
i think that’s strange .	0
i reasoned with a frenchman yesterday ,  who told me ,  in the narrow seas that part the french and english ,  there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught .	0
and so it is that i ask see your assistance .	0
thus we may see ,  ”  quoth he ,   “ how the world wags .	0
here, sweet lord, at your service.	0
it is three o'clock ,  and ,  romans ,  before night ,  we will try our luck in a second battle .	0
and does she have to die for this ?	0
ever since venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year ,  i swore i’d never speak to them again .	0
i'll carry no more sticks for him, but follow you, you amazing man.	0
doctor ,  the thanes fly from me .	0
what brings him here ?	0
if i were not forbidden to tell the secrets of my prison house, i could tell a tale whose lightest word would crush your soul, freeze your young blood, make your two eyes, like stars, jump from their sockets, your knotted and combined hair to separate, and each particular hair to stand on end like quills on the angry porcupine.	0
know’st thou not that i have fined these bones of mine for ransom ?	0
i know this act looks horrible and grim.	0
humbly i thank your grace .	0
is ’t come to this ?	0
the world is not your friend ,  and neither is the law .	0
i pray you ,  let me see it .	0
that’s true .	0
and when i told you he was involved the whole time i was trying to get desdemona ,  you were like ,   “ oh ,  really ?  ”  and then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible .	0
i do .	0
goes the king hence today ?	0
i beg you ,  in your letters ,  when you shall tell about these unlucky deeds ,  speak of me as i am; nothing farfetched ,  and don’t write anything in malice .	0
follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain, after the wearing, solely singular.	0
the earth has bubbles ,  as boiling water has ,  and these spirits are like that .	0
i fear thee !	0
abide within .	0
his forward voice now is speaking well of his friend; his backward voice is uttering dirty speeches and insults.	0
in the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we’ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor .	0
this morning ,  like the spirit of a youth that means to be of note ,  begins betimes .	0
sweet phoebe ,  pity me .	0
were you well served ,  you would be taught your duty .	0
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh .	0
i'll contact your man, and he shall bring, from time to time, news to you of every good event that happens here.	0
what would she have ?	0
a good direction ,  warlike sovereign .	0
pile of dirt !	0
why are you talking like this ?	0
thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here, shalt with him hence.	0
please ,  let’s not talk about it .	0
look, where he goes, even now out the door!	0
why ,  what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?	0
she will be pleased .	0
you pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me ?	0
pluck down forms, windows, any thing.	0
there’s mine .	0
marvelous sweet music !	0
twere good you do so much for charity .	0
o hell ,  what have we here ?	0
does anyone know if donalbain is with his brother ?	0
never in your life ,  i think ,  unless you see canary put me down .	0
his sword, which was declining on the milky head of reverend priam, seem'd i' the air to stick.	0
what said my man when my betossed soul did not attend him as we rode?	0
but that thy strange mutations make us hate thee ,  life would not yield to age .	0
if she had been blessed, she would never have loved the moor.	0
i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to slaughter .	0
for hear me ,  hero ,  wooing ,  wedding ,  and repenting is as a scotch jig ,  a measure ,  and a cinquepace .	0
my dismal scene i needs must act alone .	0
because it’s dark out ,  i’m afraid all this is just a dream ,  too sweet to be real .	0
demand .	0
you should get a wife !	0
the young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening ,  but for now he has no fangs .	0
i have drunk but one cup tonight, and that was craftily diluted too, and behold, what changes it makes here.	0
i have a wife, whom i protest i love; i would she were in heaven, so she could entreat some power to change this currish jew.	0
is it really true ?	0
so ,  prithee ,  go with me .	0
callow youth ,  you don’t yet know how to love !	0
i'll to my book, for yet ere supper-time must i perform much business appertaining.	0
bid him set on his powers betimes before ,  and we will follow .	0
help ,  charmian ,  help ,  iras ,  help !	0
see ,  they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks .	0
i am very ill at ease ,  unfit for mine own purposes .	0
i heard you do a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it was, not more than once, for the play, i remember, didn’t please the crowd, it was caviar to the particular, but it was, as i took it, and others, whose judgments in such matters far exceed mine, an excellent play, well organized in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as skill.	0
about the ninth hour ,  lady .	0
hark ,  hark ,  one knocks .	0
there sleeps titania sometime of the night ,  lulled in these flowers with dances and delight .	0
he were no lion were not romans hinds .	0
goodbye.	0
you push me far, and so i’ll give in.	0
what, mistress!	0
help ,  help ,  help !	0
i’m not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .	0
he was but a fool that brought my answer back .	0
o, be some other name!	0
a man ,  young lady !	0
pretty ophelia!	0
we’ll draw straws .	0
a seventh!	0
i pray you ,  go along with me .	0
better macbeth than such an one to reign .	0
tell me but this; have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand ?	0
my lord ,  you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the king .	0
i do forget.	0
then she is well, and nothing can be ill.	0
what have you done, my lord, with the dead body?	0
no, for that we should be coal miners.	0
if chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me without my stir.	0
fie ,  there is no such man; it is impossible .	0
o mischief ,  thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men !	0
he lies tonight within seven leagues of rome .	0
i don’t really want to do this ,  but he’s given me good reasons .	0
flout them and scout them; and scout them and flout them: thought is free .	0
here’s someone coming in his pajamas ,  with a candle and weapons .	0
i will acquit you .	0
write them down together; your name is just as good; say them out loud; your name sounds just as good; think about their importance, yours is just as important; use them to contact ghosts, "brutus" will bring a spirit as soon as "caesar.	0
a roman.	0
they wouldn’t say anything ?	0
macduff, this noble passion, child of integrity, hath from my soul wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts to thy good truth and honor.	0
twas i ,  but ’tis not i .  i do not shame to tell you what i was ,  since my conversion so sweetly tastes ,  being the thing i am .	0
what say you?	0
i wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .	0
if i may trust what happens while i sleep, my dreams predict some joyful news is coming.	0
portia ,  adieu .	0
oh margaret ,  margaret ,  your heavy curse has now landed on poor hastings’s miserable head !	0
let me stand here till thou remember it .	0
precious villain!	0
good sir, this ring was given me by my wife; and, when she put it on, she made me vow that i should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.	0
your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor; for ,  me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far more choler .	0
let them come in .	0
which is that adversary ?	0
they’ve made many raids upon italy—and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .	0
down with the montagues!	0
he was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .	0
all right .	0
do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, as needful in our loves, fitting our duty?	0
they grow like savages—like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood—surrounded by swearing and stern looks ,  ragged clothing and everything unnatural .	0
get yourself to a convent ,  fast .	0
not a hair perished .	0
one woe doth tread upon another's heel ,  so fast they follow .	0
what ,  now ?	0
i eat the air ,  promise - cramm'd .	0
i will hide you where you shall have time to speak your heart freely .	0
i’ll do it ,  if you help me out .	0
others there are ,  who ,  trimm'd in forms and visages of duty ,  keep yet their hearts attending on themselves ,  and throwing but shows of service on their lords do well thrive by them; and when they have lined their coats do themselves homage .	0
no ,  but to the gate ,  and there will the devil meet me like an old cuckold with horns on his head ,  and say ,   “ get you to heaven ,  beatrice ,  get you to heaven; here’s no place for you maids .  ”  so deliver i up my apes and away to saint peter .	0
good-morrow, friends.	0
gentlemen ,  on to the bridal dinner .	0
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband?	0
there’s not a man in all athens able to play pyramus but he.	0
god ,  god forgive us all !	0
o you foul thief, where have you hidden my daughter?	0
o braggart vile and damnèd furious wight ,  the grave doth gape ,  and doting death is near .	0
it is a great price for a small vice .	0
do thou for him stand .	0
your majesty is quite right .	0
once i’m there ,  i won’t need a guide anymore .	0
and like i am for rosalind .	0
hamlet!	0
what villains have done this ?	0
nonsense ,  i’m in their hearts ,  and i know why they do it .	0
speak behind the door.	0
o woeful day !	0
naked in bed ,  iago ,  and not mean harm !	0
a deed without a name .	0
you !	0
oh ,  my lord !	0
alack the day !	0
o child!	0
even for that i thank you; therefore, i pray you, lead me to the caskets, to try my fortune.	0
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .	0
if the common people didn’t applaud him and hiss at him, since he pleased and displeased them, as they used to do to the actors in the theatre, then i’m not really a man.	0
he should go up and offer his petition to caesar now .	0
i like not that .	0
thou art not conquer'd.	0
his youngest daughter ,  the beautiful bianca ,  is the jewel of my life ,  and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand .	0
he’s almost late .	0
would i dare do something like that ?	0
till then ,  think of the world .	0
i hear him mock the luck of caesar ,  which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath . —husband ,  i come !	0
are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children ,  a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever ?	0
know thus far north .	0
refrain to - night ,  and that shall lend a kind of easiness to the next abstinence; the next more easy; for use almost can change the stamp of nature ,  and [either master] the devil ,  or throw him out with wondrous potency .	0
of all the wonders that i yet have heard ,  it seems to me most strange that men should fear ,  seeing that death ,  a necessary end ,  will come when it will come .	0
good - bye ,  noble agrippa .	0
i do beseech your grace pardon me ,  who ,  earnest in the service of my god ,  deferred the visitation of my friends .	0
why ,  light is a function of discovering things ,  love ,  and i should be hidden .	0
what ,  ho !	0
methinks ,  mistress ,  you should have little reason for that .	0
well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.	0
good . —now come ,  ariel !	0
o rome, i promise you, if revenge follows, you will receive everything you ask for at the hand of brutus!	0
what work can you do ?	0
you’ll  “ never trust his word again .  ”  come on ,  that was a stupid thing to say .	0
or here, or at the capitol.	0
hadst thou thy wits ,  and didst persuade revenge ,  it could not move thus .	0
for michael cassio ,  i dare be sworn ,  i think ,  that he is honest .	0
it was just removed from from the heart of—oh ,  she’s dead !	0
who’d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?	0
are you answer'd ?	0
or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.	0
tis meet i should be used so, very meet.	0
well ,  in that hit you miss .	0
he’ll think these letters are from olivia and that she’s in love with him .	0
why ,   “ as by lot ,  god knows ,  ”  and then ,  you know ,  ” it came to pass ,  as most like it was .  ”  the first line of the holy song will show you more ,  for look where my means of whiling away the time comes .	0
thus it remains ,  and the remainder thus .	0
yes ,  sir ,  i have indeed .	0
i told him what i thought, and told no more than what he found himself was apt and true.	0
the what?	0
yes ,  absolutely ,  no question or ambiguity about it .	0
buck up ,  boy !	0
virtue itself can turn to vice ,  if it is misapplied; and vice is sometimes dignified by action .	0
my deeds upon my head!	0
swearing is for priests ,  cowards ,  overly cautious men ,  feeble old people ,  and those long - suffering weaklings who welcome abuse .	0
what have you found out ?	0
who governs here ?	0
is there any way i could show such friendship to you ?	0
our intent was to be gone from athens ,  where we might ,  without the peril of the athenian law .	0
out ,  you baggage !	0
it’s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .	0
this is the night that either makes me or fordoes me quite .	0
in that case ,  i don’t much care for you either .	0
you’re too forgiving .	0
do not ask to know any more .	0
there’s no bravery in an unfair fight .	0
just listen carefully while i tell you the amazing thing i saw ,  with these gentlemen as witnesses .	0
two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business ,  and they’re asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .	0
then what i have to do will need true colours ,  tears perhaps for blood .	0
what a man ,  young lady .	0
can you love the gentleman?	0
lord ,  so what ?	0
tis better thee without than he within.	0
the fractured world ,  in its confusion ,  should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions’ dens .	0
well ,  ’tis not so ,  my lord high constable .	0
what of that ?	0
what do you have to say about the french lord, monsieur le bon?	0
upon my life ,  lamord .	0
look behind you ,  my lord .	0
where am i ?	0
yes ,  it truly is .	0
what ,  drawn ,  and talk of peace ?	0
caesar might act like that .	0
i say i love you more than he does .	0
i’m afraid we shall oversleep in the morning ,  as much as we stayed up late this night .	0
good love, call him back.	0
thou canst compel no more than she entreat .	0
what are you saying ?	0
three parts of him are ours already ,  and ,  at our next meeting ,  the whole man will be ours .	0
i am more an antique roman than a dane .	0
would you like to taste the banquet ?	0
they were villains ,  murderers .	0
how many people who are humble now would be great then ?	0
but ,  hark thee ,  charmian .	0
as birds do ,  mother .	0
can i suffer that with patience but not my husband's secrets ?	0
now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber .	0
is she a capulet?	0
then is the world one .	0
upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, i'll visit you.	0
sweet soul, take care, take care of perjury; you are on your death-bed.	0
o ,  if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it; how in stripping it .	0
by god !	0
the spirit is torturing me .	0
they must lie there .	0
call them forth .	0
gracious lord ,  blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor england apart again !	0
adieu .	0
he’s dead and rotten .	0
hold on ,  then .	0
go and say we purpose her no shame .	0
do you find some occasion to anger cassio ,  either by speaking too loud ,  or tainting his discipline ,  or from what other course you please ,  which the time shall more favorably minister .	0
hardly ,  kate .	0
beat them down!	0
lucius ,  who’s that knocking ?	0
there’s dolabella sent from caesar .	0
i swear by this hand that i love you .	0
i know your position .	0
so .	0
you were you the clerk that is to betray me?	0
wast born i' th' forest here ?	0
never .	0
i have such deadly drugs, but mantua's law gives the death penalty to anybody who sells them.	0
here hung those lips that i have kissed i don’t know how many times.	0
who will go with me?	0
what time is it?	0
i’m a carpenter ,  sir .	0
there is none but he whose being i do fear ,  and under him my genius is rebuked ,  as it is said mark antony’s was by caesar .	0
be angry whenever you like ,  it’s all right with me .	0
i say my prayers out loud .	0
no ,  sir .	0
leave us alone for a little while .	0
and ,  but for ceremony ,  such a wretch ,  winding up days with toil and nights with sleep ,  had the forehand and vantage of a king .	0
that handkerchief did an egyptian to my mother give; she was a charmer ,  and could almost read the thoughts of people .	0
laertes, you shall hear them.	0
do the deed that will make this island yours forever ,  and will make me ,  caliban ,  your worshipful foot - licker .	0
how is my generous sister ?	0
what’s up ,  my man ?	0
let’s have the evidence .	0
i’ the name of truth, are ye fantastical or that indeed which outwardly ye show?	0
i have strange things in my head that need to be figured out, which must be done quickly before others look at them closely.	0
what is he at the gate ,  cousin ?	0
how now, wife?	0
you know where she is .	0
early tomorrow will we rise and hence .	0
save you ,  gentleman .	0
thank your stars that you’re brutus that speaks this way ,  or ,  by the gods ,  this speech would be your last .	0
moors are moody people . —so sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .	0
shall we check him out?	0
it is not very strange; for my uncle is king of denmark ,  and those that would make mows at him while my father lived give twenty ,  forty ,  fifty ,  a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little .	0
he’s getting crazy with expectation!	0
oh ,  it’s horrible ,  horrible .	0
stay and speak !	0
one hero died defiled ,  but i do live ,  and surely as i live ,  i am a maid .	0
marry ,  i fare well ,  for here is cheer enough .	0
i had forgot thee .	0
that’s not holy ,  it’s heresy .	0
and to run away from the jew i should be ruled by the fiend ,  who ,  saving your reverence ,  is the devil himself .	0
everyone join hands .	0
what news ,  borachio ?	0
the lunatic ,  the lover ,  and the poet are all compact in their imagination .	0
don’t lose any sleep over it.	0
this quarry cries on havoc .	0
villain, be sure you prove my love a whore; be sure of it.	0
if he’s not around ,  bring his brother oliver to me .	0
goodbye, my lord.	0
madam, here comes my lord.	0
but back to that argument you mentioned .	0
then i beat my drum ,  at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes ,  looking around for the source of my music .	0
fetch thy master home .	0
youth rebels against itself, even if no one else is near.	0
go ,  hercules !	0
i will die ,  and leave him all .	0
it’s time we hit the road .	0
you cannot, if my heart were in your hand; nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.	0
then ,  since that’s the story as it stands now ,  i think it best for you to marry the count .	0
is all our company here ?	0
are these wind instruments ?	0
no doubt ,  he’s kidnapped .	0
tell me ,  are you and ensign pistol friends again yet ?	0
it’s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .	0
yes ,  he spoke in greek .	0
no, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears, and half their faces buried in their cloaks, that by no means i may discover them by any mark of favor.	0
no ,  he's a flower ,  i believe ,  a very flower .	0
it’s not safe to be straightforward and honest .	0
why ,	0
what make you from home ?	0
he’s no standard .	0
calm down .	0
think like this all day ,  and you’ll learn how to curse .	0
he needs not our mistrust ,  since he delivers our offices and what we have to do ,  to the direction just .	0
don’t provoke me any further or i’ll forget to restrain myself .	0
these hands do lack nobility that they strike a meaner than myself ,  since i myself have given myself the cause .	0
captain macmorris ,  when there is more better opportunity to be required ,  look you ,  i will be so bold as to tell you i know the disciplines of war ,  and there is an end .	0
what’s this for ?	0
you don’t know me ,  but i know you though in your state of honor .	0
if you refuse it ,  the whole country will regret it .	0
is it upon record ,  or else reported successively from age to age ,  he built it ?	0
o, i am slain!	0
he has to pay the price for his foolish actions .	0
are you satisfied ,  jew ?	0
try to get him to do that .	0
you may do then in time .	0
petruchio ,  let’s stand over here awhile .	0
but who is that ?	0
i am satisfied .	0
then, my queen, in silence sad, trip we after night's shade.	0
i am aweary of this moon .	0
no ,  sir ,  it is legs and thighs .	0
except that there's more work .	0
and of all christian souls ,  i pray god .	0
so all .	0
give this ring to my true knight and bid him come to take his last farewell.	0
it is determined ,  not concluded yet; but so it must be if the king miscarry .	0
o, well done!	0
you’re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages .	0
your delicacies aren’t worth as much to me as your welcome is .	0
cry ,   “ whoa !  ”  to your tongue ,  please .	0
stop thinking about it ,  because nature ,  the moon ,  does not grow alone in strength and size ,  but as this temple grows ,  the inward duty of the mind and soul grows wide along with the rest .	0
poison never came from such a sweet place .	0
my bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne ,  and all this day an unaccustom'd spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts .	0
come, we'll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.	0
mislike me not for my complexion ,  the shadowed livery of the burnish'd sun ,  to whom i am a neighbour ,  and near bred .	0
alexander ,  god knows and you know ,  in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations ,  and also being a little the worse for drink ,  killed his best friend cleitus in a drunken rage ,  see .	0
make haste ,  i say .	0
what’s the matter ?	0
it is he, that villain, romeo.	0
i will go seek him.	0
to alonso] sir , — [to alonso] sir , — [to antonio] one: tell .	0
i'll to him; he is hid at laurence’ cell .	0
go ,  gratiano ,  run and overtake him; give him the ring; and bring him ,  if thou canst ,  unto antonio's house:—away !	0
for 'tis most easy the inclining desdemona to subdue in any honest suit .	0
i'll about, and drive away the vulgar from the streets; so do you too, where you perceive them thick.	0
on thursday, tell her, she shall be married to this noble earl.	0
where are you ?	0
where’s monsieur cobweb ?	0
murder ?	0
forbear this outrage !	0
wonder not till further warrant .	0
be attentive .	0
o my breast, thy hope ends here!	0
her obsequies have been as far enlarged as we have warranty.	0
i will ,  my hermia .	0
then isn’t it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?	0
you whoreson malt - horse drudge !	0
thanks ,  good my countryman .	0
farewell ,  farewell !	0
the words “villain” and his name are many miles apart.	0
go find those herbs for him ,  before his madness puts his life in danger .	0
beshrew my heart, but i pity the man.	0
so many journeys may the sun and moon make us again count o'er ere love be done !	0
why ?	0
i’m ashamed that i gave in to them .	0
we are arrant knaves all; believe none of us .	0
is it good evening?	0
go announce that he will be executed ,  and tell macbeth that cawdor’s titles will be given to him .	0
poor ropes ,  you are deceived ,  both you and i; for romeo is exiled .	0
we follow you, because we should and because we want to.	0
where’s the passage of holy scripture that you’re basing your sermon on ?	0
be patient ,  for the world is broad and wide .	0
the whole world thought your father was an honorable man ,  but he was always my enemy .	0
what warlike noise is this ?	0
are you afraid to be the same man in reality as the one you wish to be ?	0
live ,  and be prosperous ,  and ,  farewell ,  good fellow .	0
we will, we will.	0
do not think it so unwholesome .	0
i'll tell you what you shall do.	0
i know the hand: in faith ,  'tis a fair hand; and whiter than the paper it writ on ,  is the fair hand that writ .	0
he hath lost his fellows and strays about to find 'em .	0
by heaven, i saw my handkerchief in ‘s hand.	0
what undertaking ,  popilius ?	0
oh ,  let me see thee walk !	0
now he’s ready for	0
and were the king on't ,  what would i do ?	0
go, some of you, and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.	0
blest fig'send !	0
there's rue for you ,  and here's some for me .	0
well ,  other men have bad luck too .	0
get thee gone and hire those horses.	0
your grace shall have it .	0
wherefore did you so ?	0
this the nature whom passion could not shake?	0
appear before me now quickly— no talking .	0
tis a chough; but ,  as i say ,  spacious in the pos -  session of dirt .	0
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?	0
but the whole story of the night told over, and all their minds changed all at the same time, shows more witnesses than just images of the mind, and grows to something of great lasting; but, nevertheless, strange and admirable.	0
shall i be frighted when a madman stares ?	0
now the situation.	0
your wife would give you little thanks for that ,  if she were by ,  to hear you make the offer .	0
how did you dare to trade and traffic with macbeth in riddles and affairs of death; and i ,  the mistress of your charms ,  the close contriver of all harms ,  was never call'd to bear my part ,  or show the glory of our art ?	0
say that it’s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own .	0
a man named taurus ,  they say .	0
do you see the ghastliness of her eye?	0
spake you with him ?	0
i never heard so musical a noise, such sweet thunder.	0
i would govern with perfection like yours, sir, to surpass the golden age.	0
tybalt is dead ,  and romeo banishèd .  ”	0
the handkerchief !	0
won’t it be understood, when we have marked those sleepy two of his own chamber with blood, and used their very own daggers, that they have done it?	0
flute, the bellows-mender!	0
he doesn’t have any daughters ,  sir .	0
what’s going on ,  othello ,  darling ?	0
i see thee still ,  and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood ,  which was not so before .	0
let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?	0
you lie .	0
use them after your own honor and dignity .	0
i can’t go any further .	0
aside .	0
oh ,  did he so ?	0
what news can you tell me of my lord ?	0
a light ,  a light !	0
mum ,  then ,  and no more .	0
in a minute ,  in a minute !	0
then i will come to my mother by and by .	0
it is .	0
well it may turn out that this warning figure comes armed through our watch ,  looking so like the king that was and is the question of these wars .	0
what's this ?	0
his bark is stoutly timbered and his pilot of very expert and approved allowance therefore my hopes ,  not surfeited to death ,  stand in bold cure .	0
go, some of you, and bring these gentlemen where hamlet is.	0
false to me ?	0
thou canst not choose but know who i am .	0
you can heat your iron up in here .	0
those being all my study ,  the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger ,  being transported and rapt in secret studies .	0
and when he strikes back at you ,  he’ll hit you as sure as you’re standing there .	0
amen .	0
they thought they would do some naughty charm on this man and maiden, who have vowed that they will not sleep together until the god of marriage's torch is lit, but they thought so in vain.	0
he looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .	0
romeo ,  will you come to your father's ?	0
and i am sick when i don’t look at you .	0
you want me to stop in my tale against the hair .	0
do you win?	0
art thou wise ?	0
what ,  out in a storm in the middle of the night ?	0
and you told me to bury my love .	0
faith ,  we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .	0
your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	0
where is he ?	0
good night ,  my lord .	0
ay ,  my lord .	0
i grant him bloody ,  luxurious ,  avaricious ,  false ,  deceitful ,  sudden ,  malicious ,  smacking of every sin that has a name .	0
come, we'll go in here, wait for the mourners, and stay for dinner.	0
never ,  my lord .	0
very suspicious!	0
tybalt would have killed you ,  but you killed tybalt .	0
here ,  fluellen ,  stick this in your cap .	0
run when you will; the story shall be changed: apollo flies, and daphne holds the chase; the dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed, when cowardice pursues and valour flies.	0
come along with us ,  signor fabian .	0
you don’t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .	0
merciful powers ,  restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature gives way to in repose !	0
what demi-god hath come so near creation?	0
their bloody sign of battle is hung out ,  and something to be done immediately .	0
i’m afraid the people are going to choose caesar for their king .	0
thank you for asking ,  uncle .	0
i was a fine fool to take it .	0
what’s going on ,  juliet ?	0
you have done that you should be sorry for .	0
the son of duncan ,  from whom this tyrant holds the due of birth ,  lives in the english court and is received of the most pious edward with such grace that the malevolence of fortune nothing takes from his high respect .	0
a great perturbation in nature ,  to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching !	0
come ,  hamlet ,  come ,  and take this hand from me .	0
what dost thou say ?	0
what, my lord?	0
goes fleance with you ?	0
what say you ,  uncle ?	0
how do you now ,  lieutenant ?	0
no ,  monster ,  not i .	0
are you ,  fatal vision ,  as insensitive to feeling as you are to sight ?	0
behold ,  i have a weapon .	0
naked in bed ,  iago ,  and not mean harm !	0
old lord, i cannot blame thee, who am myself attached with weariness, to th’ dulling of my spirits.	0
o ,  then it moved her ?	0
younger than you, here in verona, ladies of esteem, are made already mothers.	0
scratching could not make it worse an ’twere such a face as yours were .	0
these many then shall die, their names are prick'd.	0
who bare my letter ,  then ,  to romeo ?	0
these three world - sharers ,  these competitors ,  are in thy vessel .	0
and you’re not loyal ,  like us .	0
my honored lord, you know right well you did, and with them, words composed of so sweet an air as made the things more rich.	0
find him and tell him to come here .	0
thus goes everyone to the world but i ,  and i am sunburnt .	0
what ,  with a torch !	0
did you call me ,  my lord ?	0
what ,  juliet !	0
good heart ,  at what ?	0
this lantern represents the horned moon; i myself seem to be the man in the moon .	0
meantime we thank you for your well - took labour .	0
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	0
do you know me, my lord?	0
here comes his majesty .	0
as you shall prove us ,  praise us .	0
it pleases you ,  i’ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime .	0
so god sa' me ,  ’tis shame to stand still .	0
you are a royal one ,  and we obey you .	0
i would have sworn it had ,  my lord ,  especially against benedick .	0
to alonso] sir, we were talking that our garments seem [to alonso] sir, we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is not queen.	0
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours .	0
here stands the man ,  good .	0
welcome ,  good robin .	0
knowing how much i loved my books ,  he gave me some books from my library that i value more than my dukedom .	0
and so i thank you for your good counsel .	0
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands ,  and they unwashed too ,  it’s a foul thing .	0
she speaks, yet she says nothing.	0
where's the baron of cawdor?	0
you could have come sooner .	0
lay your finger like this, and let your soul be instructed.	0
sir topas !	0
pat ,  pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal .	0
don’t bother us up here .	0
i am baron of cawdor.	0
there was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn’t let me sleep .	0
i did it while he was sleeping,—that is finished too,— and the athenian woman by his side, so that, when he woke up, she must, of course, be the first he saw.	0
as a walled town is more worthier than a village ,  so is the forehead of a married man more honorable than the bare brow of a bachelor .	0
come, madam, let’s leave.	0
what, the fair ophelia?	0
sweet ,  do not scorn her so .	0
come now ,  keep your oath; now be a freeman ,  and ,  search this chest with this good sword ,  that ran through caesar's bowels .	0
i prithee ,  vent thy folly somewhere else .	0
you should be ruled and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself .	0
hang on !	0
forgot you !	0
fair enough .	0
the next caesarion smite ,  till by degrees the memory of my womb ,  together with my brave egyptians all ,  by the discandying of this pelleted storm lie graveless till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey !	0
thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture ,  to be so taken at thy peril ,  jew .	0
who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?	0
on thy love ,  i charge thee .	0
the french have reinforced their scattered men .	0
until i know it is done ,  however great my luck ,  my joys can never begin .	0
pitiful sight !	0
or blessèd was't we did?	0
you may do so:—but let it be so hasted, that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock.	0
you’re right ,  lysander’s admirable too .	0
didn’t you hear their shouts ?	0
i hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !	0
while the moon was shining we didn’t even notice the candle .	0
if a christian wrongs a jew, what should his choice be by christian example?	0
by a name that i don’t know how to tell you who i am .	0
lay thy finger thus ,  and let thy soul be instructed .	0
and the right valiant banquo was out too late, whom, you may say, if it please you, was killed by fleance, because fleance fled.	0
greetings to your lordship!	0
that you shall surely find him ,  lead to the sagittary the raisèd search ,  and there will i be with him .	0
for in all the play there is not one word apt ,  one player fitted .	0
until then ,  i have to remain calm .	0
now, what's the business?	0
these tedious old fools !	0
who knocks so hard ?	0
show !	0
stay in the dark .	0
i’m telling you ,  aliena ,  i can’t stand being apart from orlando .	0
let me get her.	0
but this same cassio ,  though he speak of comfort touching the turkish loss ,  yet he looks sadly and prays the moor be safe; for they were parted with foul and violent tempest .	0
will you have dinner with me tonight ,  casca ?	0
he has no children .	0
why then ,  god forgive me .	0
oh ,  damn ,  damn ,  damn !	0
well ,  well ,  jealous oberon !	0
i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment.	0
you are welcome, masters; welcome, all.	0
well ,  juliet ,  i will lie with thee tonight .	0
i have lost my hopes .	0
bring me the fairest creature northward born ,  where phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles ,  and let us make incision for your love ,  to prove whose blood is reddest ,  his ,  or mine .	0
there are ways to regain the general again .	0
you, mistress, that have the office next to saint peter, and keep the gate of hell!	0
holy franciscan friar !	0
to her that is not here ,  nor doth not hear .	0
o cursed spite, that ever i was born to set it right!	0
as i am an honest man ,  i thought you had received some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputa -  tion .	0
i’ll go hunting again tomorrow ,  i think .	0
can you bring me to him ?	0
why, how is it now!	0
we shall obey ,  were she ten times our mother .	0
yes ,  and be wise .	0
alas, good gentleman!	0
to hear this, desdemona would seriously listen, but still the house affairs would draw her away, which she would finish in a great hurry, and she’d come again, and eat up my stories with a greedy ear, which i observing, once i took a rare hour; and found good ways to draw a prayer of earnest enthusiasm from her so that i would lengthen all my stories, which she had already heard bits and pieces of, but not all of them.	0
that's fouler.	0
his word might bear my wealth at any time .	0
you ,  mistress ,  that have the office opposite to saint peter ,  and keep the gate of hell !	0
oh ,  relation too nice and yet too true !	0
i pray you ,  remember the porter .	0
when this burns ,  'twill weep for having wearied you .	0
look ,  here she comes .	0
honor ,  riches ,  marriage - blessing ,  long life ,  and many children ,  hourly joys be always yours !	0
kings and noblemen served him .	0
why ,  sir ,  i’m a carpenter .	0
go a little before .	0
yet i love thee too .	0
but as for this ring ,  please excuse me .	0
i'll call upon you in a minute .	0
must there no more be done?	0
good laertes ,  if you desire to know the certainty of your dear father's death ,  is't writ in your revenge that ,  swoopstake ,  you will draw both friend and foe ,  winner and loser ?	0
beggar that i am ,  i am even poor in thanks; but i thank you ,  and sure ,  dear friends ,  my thanks are too dear a halfpenny .	0
therefore get you on and give him his desire .	0
ay ,  desdemona .	0
why shouldn’t i ?	0
if thy speech be sooth ,  i care not if thou dost for me as much .	0
and i have been all this day to avoid him .	0
nay ,  not sound ,  i pray you .	0
keep your cabins .	0
let’s withdraw ,  my lord .	0
twas of some estate .	0
look how it steals away !	0
is this a dagger which i see before me ,  the handle toward my hand ?	0
great mark antony is a widower now .	0
o ,  be gone !	0
rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!	0
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am .	0
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .	0
doesn’t the day break here?	0
do not say ‘banishment.’ hence from verona art thou banished.	0
didst thou not say he lied?	0
i shall.	0
oh ,  that bird from hell !	0
not yet quite dead ?	0
are those men waiting for us?	0
have courage ,  man .	0
have you the lion's part written ?	0
right glad i am he was not at this fray .	0
this is just a trifling matter here ,  sir .	0
i wouldn’t have them see you here for the world .	0
what trash rome is, what rubbish, and what garbage, when it serves as the fuel to start a fire that will throw light on so vile a thing as caesar!	0
when i tell him he hates flatterers ,  he agrees ,  just at the moment when i’m flattering him the most .	0
no ,  sir ,  i won’t let you go .	0
my liege ,  this man is a villain and a traitor ,  who—see ,  your grace—has struck the glove which your majesty took from alençon’s helmet .	0
i’d trust him with everything i own .	0
as for my daughter katherine ,  this much i know: she’s not for you—more’s the pity .	0
withdraw; i hear him coming .	0
that's two of his weapons .	0
how goes it now ?	0
nor ever heard ,  nor ever did suspect .	0
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bunghole ?	0
lepidus is high - colored .	0
a pox o’ your throat ,  you bawling ,  blasphemous ,  incharitable dog !	0
and ever will—though he do shake me off to beggarly divorcement—love him dearly ,  comfort forswear me !	0
nay ,  let’s follow him .	0
how satisfied, my lord?	0
hold your peace .	0
farewell!	0
i took no more pains for those thanks than you took pains to thank me .  ”  that’s as much as to say ,   “ any pains that i take for you is as easy as thanks .  ”  if i do not take pity of her ,  i am a villain .	0
gentlemen ,  calm down .	0
receive it so .	0
or blessè was ’t we did ?	0
swear priests and cowards, and deceitful men, old feeble dead bodies and such suffering souls that welcome wrongs; swear to bad causes that such creatures as men doubt, but don’t stain the even goodness of our undertaking, or the unsuppressed character of our spirits, to think that our cause and our performance need oaths, when every drop of blood that every roman carries, and carries nobly, is guilty of causing the birth of several bastards, if he breaks the smallest particle of any promise that he has made.	0
stop thy unhallowed toil, vile montague!	0
some are born great ,  some achieve greatness ,  and some have greatness thrust upon 'em .	0
how lush and lusty the grass looks!	0
a sick man in sadness makes his will ,  a word ill urged to one that is so ill .	0
to take ’t again perforce— monster ingratitude !	0
what's that, my lord?	0
no ,  but ophelia i beg you ,  listen .	0
ay ,  and i’ll give them him without a fee .	0
by the gods ,  you’ll eat the poison of your proud temper ,  even if it splits you ,  because ,  from this day on ,  i'll use you for my entertainment ,  yes ,  for my laughter ,  when you’re spiteful .	0
you hit my servants ,  and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .	0
how am i then a villain to counsel cassio to this parallel course, directly to his good?	0
you lie .	0
bernardo.	0
this is that time .	0
come ,  brands ,  ho ,  firebrands .	0
and what other oath than honesty to honesty engaged that this shall be or we will fall for it ?	0
that’s why i wish my sister didn’t have a name ,  sir .	0
we only drink toasts to my niece .	0
as low as to thy foot doth cassius fall to beg enfranchisement for publius cimber .	0
this is the abscess of much wealth and peace, that breaks inward, and shows no damage until the man dies.	0
give me your hands ,  if we be friends ,  and robin shall restore amends .	0
still be kind and eke out our performance with your mind .	0
of nothing .	0
but why unkindly didst thou leave me so ?	0
a lover ,  or a tyrant ?	0
why then ,  let fall your horrible pleasure .	0
god be with my old master .	0
if you are human ,  don’t stand for it .	0
turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.	0
there are still some streaks of day in the west .	0
if they’d put you in the stocks for asking that question ,  you would’ve deserved it .	0
give me my sin back .	0
o, by whom?	0
pray you ,  go with us .	0
your sword on a woman?	0
that she is worthy ,  i know .	0
o ,  that a man might know how today's business ends before it comes !	0
but ,  sir ,  forgive me ,  since my becomings kill me when they do not eye well to you .	0
boatswain !	0
why, thou silly gentleman!	0
is it possible ?	0
if it might please you to enforce no further the griefs between ye ,  to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you .	0
goneril would go crazy if i chose regan ,  but it would be hard to get in with goneril while her husband’s still alive .	0
indeed !	0
i wish i had not lived long enough to see him die .	0
we shouldn’t make any judgments until we achieve our goal .	0
let me peruse this face .	0
will you dine with me tomorrow ?	0
tut ,  tut ,  thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes .	0
ay ,  dread queen .	0
i never offended him at all .	0
sure there's some wonder in this handkerchief; i am most unhappy in the loss of it.	0
demetrius doesn’t think so; he won’t know what everyone but him knows.	0
o day !	0
we charge you ,  in the prince’s name ,  stand !	0
you may deny me to be your friend; but i'll be your servant ,  whether you will want me or not .	0
you’ll  enough of this .	0
ask your daughters for another one .	0
the things that threatened me ne'er looked but on my back .	0
and so ,  my lord ,  adieu .	0
what a backward world we live in !	0
since my dear soul was mistress of her choice and could of men distinguish ,  her election hath sealed thee for herself ,  for thou hast been— as one in suffering all that suffers nothing— a man that fortune’s buffets and rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks .	0
only an hour ago it was nine ,  and in another hour it will be eleven .	0
handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief !	0
cassio screwed her; ask your husband otherwise .	0
if you do ,  please give it to me ,  because i need to start learning the lines .	0
what’s he ?	0
your lieutenant ,  if you like; he's no main officer .	0
look you here ,  here is himself ,  marr'd ,  as you see ,  with traitors .	0
later ,  in a better world than this ,  i’d love to get to know you .	0
what’s the matter ?	0
i have seen nothing .	0
laertes ,  was your father dear to you ?	0
i tell you ,  there are good men born at monmouth .	0
heaven will guide its course.	0
did we ,  my lord ?	0
but, look!	0
alas ,  i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself .	0
masters, the duke is coming from the temple; and there is two or three lords and ladies more married.	0
here she comes ,  cursed and sad .	0
here, my lord.	0
here comes the furious tybalt back again .	0
the attempt, and not the deed, confuses us.	0
who’s there ,  besides foul weather ?	0
in my mind's eye ,  horatio .	0
happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grave the sovereignty thereof .	0
be eloquent on my behalf .	0
where are his eyes ?	0
i do beg you ,  give him permission to go .	0
they follow the king’s pleasure .	0
only why stands macbeth in this way amazedly?	0
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be !	0
tybalt would kill thee ,  but thou slewest tybalt .	0
why then ,  the devil give him good of it !	0
i wouldn’t follow him then.	0
doesn’t she count her blessings that unworthy as she is ,  we have secured so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ?	0
mine shall be spent when theirs are dry ,  for romeo’s banishment .	0
upon the crown o' th' cliff ,  what thing was that which parted from you ?	0
i’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good ,  honest person ,  sir .	0
fled to england ?	0
what ,  are you busy ?	0
why sweat they under burdens ?	0
i do not understand .	0
yes ,  my lord .	0
let me sit down .	0
a great welcome home!	0
what fool is this ?	0
o dear phoebe ,  if ever—as that ever may be near— you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy ,  then shall you know the wounds invisible that love’s keen arrows make .	0
hortensio ,  what’s all this about ?	0
you have obtained it .	0
soft ,  who comes here ?	0
the question of his death is enrolled in the capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered death.	0
i looked her in the face ,  and saw her led between her brother and mark antony .	0
thou know’st not gold’s effect .	0
knock, knock, knock!	0
did you try to get him to engage in any pastime?	0
i must needs after him ,  madam ,  with my letter .	0
yes ,  as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .	0
are you hurt ,  lieutenant ?	0
therefore to our best mercy give yourselves or ,  like to men proud of destruction ,  defy us to our worst .	0
as shafalus to procrus, i am to you.	0
an we do not ,  it is pity of our lives .	0
she lies there, like the flower that she was, her virginity taken by him.	0
who builds stronger than a mason, a ship- wright, or a carpenter?	0
enough with the bad faces, and begin.	0
i’ll leave him alone .	0
good madam ,  let me speak .	0
we will not have enough food and drink for this feast .	0
her speech is nothing ,  yet the random use of it moves the listeners to collect them ,  they aim at making sense of it ,  and mix her words up fit to their own ideas ,  which ,  as her winks and nods and gestures as she speaks ,  would indeed make someone think there might be clear ,  though nothing for sure ,  yet very unhappily .	0
into my grave .	0
the hour has almost come when i have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .	0
no one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep .	0
by mary, heaven forbid!	0
poisoned ,  then .	0
or stole it, rather.	0
the son and heir of old tiberio .	0
what you know ,  you know .	0
do i entice you?	0
there are some such, no doubt.	0
let’s go .	0
i demand to be satisfied .	0
who cannot think how monstrous it was for malcolm and for donalbain to kill their gracious father ?	0
reputation ,  reputation ,  reputation !	0
that which we call a rose would smell as sweet if it had any other name .	0
madam ,  in happy time ,  what day is that ?	0
then ,  in the name of god and all these rights ,  advance your standards .	0
read the will; we'll hear it, antony.	0
oh ,  no .	0
why ,  man ,  he’s a very devil .	0
he did appoint so .	0
sitting on a bank ,  weeping again the king my father’s wrack ,  this music crept by me upon the waters ,  allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air .	0
let her send it .	0
nor i neither by this heavenly light; i might do't as well i' the dark .	0
i say she never did invent this letter .	0
there lock yourself and send him word you are dead .	0
have you forgotten the foul witch sycorax, who had grown in to a circle with age and envy?	0
i’ll wear this one and none other .	0
these evils thou repeat'st upon thyself have banish'd me from scotland.	0
what, not a whore?	0
i think it was at sea .	0
in sadness, cousin, i do love a woman.	0
look to't ,  i charge you .	0
behold: it is the privilege of mine honors ,  my oath ,  and my profession .	0
what ,  my good lord ?	0
is it possible ?	0
i don’t know anything that i said or did wrong this night, unless self-love is sometimes a vice, and to defend ourselves is a sin when we are attacked violently.	0
please ,  one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .	0
yes, indeed.	0
hey !	0
this casket threatens: men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages: a golden mind stoops not to shows of dross; i'll then nor give ,  nor hazard ,  aught for lead .	0
fear will keep you safe .	0
so ,  uncle ,  there you are .	0
a good and virtuous nature may recoil in an imperial charge .	0
well thought on .	0
if his cause is wrong ,  our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .	0
murder !	0
i am jester to oberon and make him smile, as when i trick a fat horse that’s been eating beans into neighing like a newborn female; and sometimes, i hide near to the town gossip's beer mug, looking like a roasted crab; and, when the gossip drinks, i bob up, against her lips, and pour the ale on the withered skin of her neck skin all the way down.	0
give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence . — nor you ,  lorenzo . —jessica ,  nor you .	0
isn’t he a very unholy and rude counselor?	0
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief?	0
o ,  teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius' heart .	0
are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?	0
why do you speak so softly ?	0
i wish them all safe trips home .	0
have you ever cured anyone this way before ?	0
when you ask for my blessing ,  i’ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me .	0
sir ,  we’ll follow as soon as mark antony kisses octavia good - bye .	0
he strongly fortifies great dunsinane .	0
what if she is black and witty?	0
can any prayers get through to you?	0
no, unpin my hair.	0
this letter is for you from signor antonio .	0
stand fast together ,  lest some friend of caesar’s should chance— talk not of standing . —publius ,  good cheer .	0
i shall obey, my lord.	0
but you ,  o you ,  so perfect and so peerless ,  are created of every creature’s best .	0
i’ll never see my gold again .	0
let her be thine ,  for we have no such daughter ,  nor shall ever see that face of hers again .	0
poor painted queen ,  vain flourish of my fortune ,  why strew’st thou sugar on that bottled spider ,  whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?	0
you’ll be my wife ,  dearest ,  and i’ll serve you forever .	0
poor knave ,  i don’t blame you; you’ve been wake up too long .	0
save yourself ,  my lord .	0
malcolm!	0
with all my heart .	0
aside] the charm dissolves apace, [aside] the charm dissolves apace, and as the morning steals upon the night, melting the darkness, so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason.—o good gonzalo, my true preserver, and a loyal sir to him you follow'st!	0
she seemed to be trying to control her emotions ,  which were overwhelming her .	0
i don’t want you to know ,  dearest sweetheart ,  until you can applaud the deed .	0
look !	0
my father’s bears more toward the marketplace .	0
a sail.	0
everything is gloomy ,  dark ,  and dreadful .	0
ho!	0
how long do you intend to stay within this forest ?	0
yes ,  it’s definitely nippy .	0
what ,  lamb !	0
a braggart ,  a rogue ,  a villain ,  that fights by the book of arithmetic !	0
i will look further into ’t .	0
i'll lay fourteen of my teeth— and yet ,  to my teen be it spoken ,  i have but four— she is not fourteen .	0
i loved him ,  friend— no father his son dearer .	0
but get thee back .	0
a soothsayer bids you beware the ides of march.	0
and i .	0
they are weary ?	0
then ,  do my lips have the sin that they have taken from yours ?  .	0
to you, antonio, i owe the most, in money and in friendship, and, from your friendship, i have a guarantee to get rid of all my plots and intentions as to how to get clear all the debts i owe.	0
all this so suddenly ? —edmund ,  what’s going on ?	0
say he is sick.	0
o devil !	0
he is address'd; press near and second him .	0
and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend ?	0
pretty ophelia !	0
patience ,  i say .	0
the ottomites ,  reverend and gracious ,  steering with due course toward the isle of rhodes ,  have there injointed them with an after fleet .	0
look what i have .	0
what should i pay you ?	0
how can that be ?	0
thou hast taken against me a most just exception ,  but yet i protest i have dealt most directly in thy affair .	0
i understand a fury in your words ,  but not the words .	0
they say the owl was a baker's daughter.	0
it was most terrible to hear.	0
thisbe!	0
unfaithful ?	0
well ,  come ,  my kate .	0
i am very proud ,  revengeful ,  ambitious ,  with more offenses at my command than i have thoughts to put them in ,  imagination to give them shape ,  or time to commit them in .	0
portia is dead .	0
men that hazard all do it in hope of fair advantages .	0
have mercy ,  jesu ! —soft ,  i did but dream .	0
this likes me well .	0
they say that this town is full of deception—illusionists that can fool the eye ,  dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind ,  soul - killing witches who can disfigure your body ,  disguised swindlers ,  fast - talking fakers ,  and all kinds of other unchecked sins .	0
your fortune stood upon the caskets there, and so did mine too, as the matter falls: for wooing here, until i sweat again, and swearing until my very roof was dry with oaths of love, at last,—if promise last,— i got a promise of this fair one here, to have her love, provided that your fortune achiev'd her mistress.	0
forty thousand brothers ,  if you added all their love together ,  couldn’t match mine .	0
and thy father was duke of milan ,  and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued .	0
never ,  until caesar's thirty - three wounds are well avenged ,  or until another caesar has added slaughter to the sword of traitors .	0
i will preach to the world for him; that is, make questions and answer them.	0
now is the day we long have lookèd for .	0
a man that all his time hath founded his good fortunes on your love ,  shared dangers with you— the handkerchief !	0
now ,  lords ,  don’t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .	0
his honor and myself are at the one ,  and at the other is my good friend catesby ,  where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence .	0
romeo shall thank thee ,  daughter ,  for us both .	0
so be it .	0
signior gratiano ?	0
i should not need ,  if you were gentle brutus .	0
what ,  banishment ?	0
ay ,  and a bold one ,  that dare look on that which might appal the devil .	0
therefore ,  good emilia ,  give me my nightly wearing ,  and adieu .	0
therefore be out of hope ,  of question ,  of doubt .	0
who’s there ?	0
and what have i to give you back whose worth may counterpoise this rich and precious gift ?	0
look to your house ,  your daughter ,  and your bags !	0
that baron of cawdor shall no longer betray matters close to our heart.	0
you have known what you should not .	0
yes ,  it already has garrisons .	0
yet would i knew that stroke would prove the worst !	0
you were best go in .	0
it shall lose thee nothing .	0
i will calculate your love from this time forward .	0
what is yon gentleman ?	0
we will, we will!	0
please you ,  farther .	0
yet ,  i beseech you ,  if you think fit ,  or that it may be done ,  give me advantage of some brief discourse with desdemona alone .	0
this ,  this all souls' day to my fearful soul is the determined respite of my wrongs .	0
and all for nothing!	0
looking just like the dead king .	0
i gave her such a one; it was my first gift .	0
you cannot start to ask the king of denmark, and then stop.	0
o villainy!	0
with nothing but truth.	0
what should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?	0
and weren’t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends ,  like aegles ,  ariadne ,  and antiopa ?	0
a worthy fool !	0
the point poisoned too !	0
horatio says we’re imagining it ,  and won’t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we’ve seen twice now .	0
and by all means stir on the youth to an answer .	0
snout ,  the tinker !	0
whither goest thou ?	0
there's a poor piece of gold for thee.	0
thou art thy father’s daughter .	0
good night, lieutenant, i must to the watch.	0
she might lie by an emperor's side and order him to work .	0
i thumb my nose at superstitions .	0
all that i have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon; i ,  the man i' the moon; this thorn - bush ,  my thorn - bush; and this dog ,  my dog .	0
shall i go fetch your nightgown?	0
but we are spirits of another sort .	0
let her awhile be secretly kept in and publish it that she is dead indeed .	0
i humbly thank your ladyship .	0
when you weren’t at home ,  the senate sent out three different search parties to find you .	0
how wilt thou do for a father ?	0
oh ,  say so ,  and so be !	0
i give him curses, yet he gives me love.	0
o wife, look how our daughter bleeds!	0
marry ,  sir ,  here's my drift ,  and i believe it is a fetch of warrant .	0
o, how may i call this a lightning?	0
where are you going ?	0
i have news from rome ,  my good lord .	0
the duke of gloucester ,  to whom the order of the siege is given ,  is altogether directed by an irishman ,  a very valiant gentleman ,  i' faith .	0
where are my swiss guards ?	0
do you understand me?	0
i will prove it legitimate ,  sir ,  upon the oaths of judgment and reason .	0
you have my consent .	0
now my charms are all o'erthrown ,  and what strength i have’s mine own ,  which is most faint .	0
and what's in prayer but this twofold force, to be forestalled ere we come to fall, or pardon'd being down?	0
i insist ,  don’t be more distressed than i am .	0
tis in my memory lock'd, and you yourself shall keep the key of it.	0
as long as hell and richard want it .	0
though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better ,  yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself— a thousand times more fair ,  ten thousand times more rich— that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue ,  beauties ,  livings ,  friends exceed account .	0
and has anyone ever won her ,  as i’ve done ?	0
i must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp .	0
it is clean out of the way .	0
stay then; i'll go alone.	0
you are too much mistaken in this king .	0
i’m going to stand so i can see him pass on the way to the capitol .	0
impatient that i was gone, and upset that young octavius with mark antony has made themselves so strong;—because that news came with the news of her death;—with all this, she became crazy, and, without her attendants present, swallowed fire.	0
by mary ,  heaven forbid !	0
there is a kind of merry war betwixt signor benedick and her .	0
but who did bid thee join with us ?	0
you ,  mistress ,  all this trouble is because of you .	0
believe what ?	0
how long have you been a grave-maker?	0
no; he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in athens .	0
how are you ,  your highness ?	0
i'll fetch him presently .	0
so thrive my soul— a thousand times good night !	0
o ,  you and i have heard our fathers say there was a brutus once that would have fought the eternal devil to keep his status in rome ,  as easily as he would fight a king !	0
no mind that's honest but in it shares some woe ,  though the main part pertains to you alone .	0
is that the law?	0
but i pray ,  can you read anything you see ?	0
love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; but love from love ,  towards school with heavy looks .	0
if it be no more, portia is brutus' harlot, not his wife.	0
hard - handed men that work in athens here ,  which never labour'd in their minds till now; and now have toil'd their unbreathed memories with this same play against your nuptial .	0
what must be shall be .	0
is that any thing now ?	0
the duke cannot deny the course of law, because of the benefits that strangers have with us in venice, if it is denied, it will reflect very badly on the justice of the state, because the trade and profit of the city is from all nations.	0
endless weeping for your cousin's death ?	0
there the men are as crazy as he is .	0
what wound did ever heal but by degrees ?	0
peace ,  grumio .	0
yes ,  yes ,  and let’s sing in unison ,  like two gypsies riding on a single horse .	0
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness .	0
no, we’ll all be there to go get him.	0
go, captain, from me greet the danish king.	0
when the moon shone, we did not see the candle.	0
even so .	0
lady !	0
to adriana .	0
and if you wrong us ,  shall we not revenge ?	0
besides ,  you grow dishonest .	0
why comest thou ?	0
why didst thou send me forth ,  brave cassius ?	0
that is the very defect of the matter ,  sir .	0
but lest my liking might too sudden seem ,  i would have salved it with a longer treatise .	0
i loved you ever .	0
yet is this no charm for the toothache . —old signior ,  walk aside with me .	0
what trash rome is ,  what rubbish ,  and what garbage ,  when it serves as the fuel to start a fire that will throw light on so vile a thing as caesar !	0
and what a slug hastings is that he hasn’t even arrived to tell us whether they’re coming !	0
earth's increase ,  foison plenty ,  barns and garners never empty ,  vines and clust'ring bunches growing ,  plants and goodly burden bowing; spring come to you at the farthest in the very end of harvest !	0
you can hope your father isn’t your real father .	0
alas ,  you know not .	0
so go on ,  tell me the news .	0
most certain ,  if you are she ,  you do usurp yourself ,  for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .	0
alas ,  my lord ,  your wisdom is consumed in confidence !	0
now ,  how do you look now ?	0
shall i do such a deed ?	0
i know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand; and whiter than the paper it writ on, is the fair hand that writ.	0
thursday is coming .	0
tell me what i want to know .	0
nay ,  an i tell you that ,  i’ll ne'er look you i' th' face again .	0
why did you bring these daggers from the place ?	0
and why should caesar be a tyrant then?	0
a  what’s going on ?	0
the table of contents says it’s in the first chapter of his heart .	0
is that the uttermost?	0
what ,  shall i groan and tell you ?	0
let me see; i’ll look over the inscriptions again .	0
did this happen before the king of france returned home ?	0
tis proper i obey him ,  but not now .	0
one .	0
what if i had said i had seen him do you wrong?	0
yes ,  ma'am .	0
pardon, i beseech you!	0
i could really use his advice right now .	0
say either good or bad ,  and i'll wait for the details .	0
why don’t you have a seat ,  your highness ?	0
oh ,  i could weep my soul right out of myself !	0
at my humble house tonight ,  you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .	0
did he confess it?	0
i’ll leave you now .	0
oh ,  you mighty gods !	0
goodbye, good launcelot.	0
but once he got there ,  the duke learned that lorenzo and his lover jessica were together in a gondola .	0
thy mother’s name is ominous to children .	0
but let me to my fortune and the caskets .	0
i'll be right behind you .	0
her father and i, lawful spies, will so hide ourselves that, seeing but unseen, we may honestly judge their encounter, and gather from him, or how he behaves, if it’s the affliction of his love or not that he suffers like this for.	0
so, now you're paid.	0
good sir ,  this ring was given me by my wife; and ,  when she put it on ,  she made me vow that i should neither sell ,  nor give ,  nor lose it .	0
that makes us kinder ,  to give them thanks for nothing .	0
alas ,  good kate ,  i will not burden thee ,  for knowing thee to be but young and light— too light for such a swain as you to catch ,  and yet as heavy as my weight should be .	0
look ,  he recovers .	0
good night—but go not to mine uncle’s bed .	0
how absolute the knave is !	0
yes ,  he knew about it the whole time .	0
i don’t doubt your wisdom .	0
all this?	0
bring the villain out .	0
notwithstanding ,  use your pleasure .	0
ay .	0
i think i can discover him ,  if you please to get good guard ,  and go along with me .	0
for my part ,  i have walk'd about the streets ,  submitting me unto the perilous night ,  and thus unbraced ,  casca ,  as you see ,  have bared my bosom to the thunder - stone; and when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open the breast of heaven ,  i did present myself even in the aim and very flash of it .	0
adultery ?	0
to eat us hungerly ,  and when they are full ,  they belch us .	0
the king and prince at prayers!	0
this cannot anger him .	0
which he quickly allowed ,  given that you’re an obstacle to his lust .	0
whom should we look for in the castle ? —whose job is it ?	0
find out what this villainous edgar is thinking ,  edmund .	0
it is two or three ,  my lord ,  that bring you word macduff is fled to england .	0
how satisfied, my lord?	0
this fortification ,  gentlemen ,  shall we see ’t ?	0
if the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to balance another of sensuality ,  the blood and baseness of our natures would lead us to very preposterous conclusions .	0
because everything is sealed and done that relies on this affair.	0
for that reason, good brutus, get ready to hear what i have to say; and since you know you can’t see yourself except in a mirror, i’ll be your mirror, and will modestly let you see that in yourself which you don’t know about.	0
i can only think that desdemona's honest.	0
come on ,  i’ll take you ,  but honestly i’m only doing it out of pity .	0
no, that's not so.	0
calphurnia !	0
i will plague them all ,  even to the point of their roaring .	0
and she's fair who i love.	0
why ,  'tis not possible .	0
did you say all?	0
i swear i will never break this promise of love .	0
who’s next ?	0
when beggars die there are no comets seen .	0
a daughter?	0
oh ,  who hath done this deed ?	0
death of thy soul!	0
tis too narrow for your mind .	0
content thee ,  gentle coz ,  let him alone .	0
so, you're paid.	0
nor our strong sorrow [aside to donalbain .	0
where’s my father ?	0
but i’ll admit i don’t care for you .	0
sweet bassanio ,  my ships have all sunk ,  my creditors grow cruel ,  my funds very low ,  my promise to pay to the jew is in default; and since ,  in paying it ,  it is impossible for me to live ,  all debts between you and me are canceled if i might only see you at my death .	0
i did ,  my lord .	0
i say, away!	0
they call for dates and quinces in the pastry .	0
then it is most likely that the crown will fall upon macbeth.	0
he came too late .	0
thou dost ,  and think'st it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep ,  to run upon the sharp wind of the north ,  to do me business in the veins o'th’ earth when it is baked with frost .	0
then walk we forth ,  even to the marketplace ,  and waving our red weapons o'er our heads let’s all cry ,   “ peace ,  freedom ,  and liberty !  ”  stoop ,  then ,  and wash .	0
there are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again .	0
the head is not more native to the heart, the hand more instrumental to the mouth, than is the throne of denmark to your father.	0
gamble for lead !	0
o, what a great thing learning is!	0
i'll send her to you presently; and i'll devise a mean to draw the moor out of the way, that your converse and business may be more free.	0
it makes us, or it mars us; think on that, and fix most firm thy resolution.	0
i thought all for the best .	0
and that would get us all executed .	0
there ,  gentle hermia ,  may i marry thee .	0
if any ,  speak—for him have i offended .	0
the punto reverso!	0
with all my heart, sir.	0
it would be inappropriate—dangerous ,  even—for me to be seen working against the moor ,  as i would if i stayed .	0
looking at the guts of an offering ,  they couldn’t find a heart inside the beast .	0
and, if you babble about mountains, let them throw millions of acres on us, until our ground, singeing his head against the burning sun, make the highest mountain like a wart!	0
then i beat my tabor ,  at which ,  like unbacked colts ,  they pricked their ears ,  advanced their eyelids ,  lifted up their noses as they smelt music .	0
the dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !	0
well then ,  it now appears you need my help .	0
if i’m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this ,  whip the first person who thinks i sound foolish .	0
hooray !	0
but, orderly to end where i begun, our wills and fates do so contrary run that our devices still are overthrown; our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.	0
only call me “love,” and i'll be baptized with a new name.	0
claudius!	0
no thanks from his mouth, if it were alive to thank you.	0
obey ,  and go with me; for thou must die .	0
locked in her monument .	0
cut my corset laces ,  charmian ,  so i can breathe .	0
they bore him barefac'd on the bier (hey non nony ,  nony ,  hey nony) and on his grave rain'd many a tear .	0
harder ,  harder .	0
lead the way .	0
what makes that frontlet on ?	0
i’ll be with you right away.	0
most unholy murder has broken open the lord's anointed temple ,  and then stolen the life of the building .	0
how strange that they all got so sleepy !	0
yet say i ,  he is in love .	0
shylock is my name.	0
you’re wrong ,  sir ,  very wrong .	0
let us go sit here upon the church bench till two ,  and then all to bed .	0
they are of norway ,  sir .	0
my hands are the same color as yours ,  only i would be ashamed to have such a white heart .	0
to feed were best at home; from thence the sauce to meat is ceremony; meeting were bare without it .	0
the king is not to answer it .	0
sir ,  the person who should sing that song isn’t here .	0
rest you merry!	0
i don’t owe her any duty—it’s you that i submit to .	0
it would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.	0
i know not what i shall think of that: but i am launcelot, the jew's man; and i am sure margery, your wife, is my mother.	0
why ,  that’s my dainty ariel .	0
and trust me ,  love ,  in my eyes ,  so do you .	0
farewell happiness!	0
not dead ?	0
but in the meantime ,  just assume that i’m paranoid—as i’m pretty sure i am—and keep thinking she’s innocent ,  please .	0
o, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps; and now falls on her bed, and then starts up, and tybalt calls; and then on romeo cries, and then down falls again.	0
let not thy mother lose her prayers ,  hamlet .	0
no more .	0
to who ?	0
tybalt is gone, and romeo banished; romeo killed him; he is banished.	0
you wrong'd yourself to write in such a case .	0
see ,  and then speak yourselves .	0
the ousel cock ,  so black of hue ,  with orange - tawny bill ,  the throstle with his note so true ,  the wren with little quill .	0
why ?	0
his speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired ,  but all disordered .	0
good gentlemen ,  look fresh and merrily .	0
too much of water hast thou ,  poor ophelia ,  and therefore i forbid my tears; but yet it is our trick; nature her custom holds ,  let shame say what it will .	0
a madness most discreet ,  a choking gall ,  and a preserving sweet .	0
i do not ,  till you practise them on me .	0
as woman's love .	0
yes ,  the fashion is the fashion .	0
marry ,  thou dost wrong me ,  thou dissembler ,  thou .	0
why do you stay?	0
travel to mantua .	0
maintain a mourning ostentation ,  and on your family’s old monument hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites that appertain unto a burial .	0
well ,  then i shall see thee again ?	0
do not approach till thou dost hear me call .	0
for god’s sake ,  take a house .	0
and too soon marr'd are those so early made .	0
since no man has aught of what he leaves ,  what is't to leave betimes ?	0
the ambassadors are back from norway ,  sir .	0
no ,  no ,  no ,  no !	0
fellow ,  come from the throng; look upon caesar .	0
come on ,  i’ll escort you to dinner .	0
i will catch up with you ,  cleopatra ,  and weep for your forgiveness .	0
i’ll go with you ,  my lord ,  if you’ll allow me .	0
the moon goes down at twelve.	0
he never did harm that i heard of .	0
you kick me out ,  he kicks me back .	0
young man ,  your father’s dead .	0
are they not now upon the western shore ,  safe - conducting the rebels from their ships ?	0
with all my heart ,  i’ll join you .	0
what can i say to him ,  lady ?	0
your husband knew it all .	0
i’ll confess to you that i love him .	0
damn !	0
scale of dragon, tooth of wolf, witch's mummy, a gulf-like stomach, of the rough sea salt glisten, root of poison hemlock dug up in the dark, liver of christians not baptized, gall bladder of goat, and slips of pine trees cut off the tree when the moon eclipsed, nose of turk, and tartar's lips, finger of a baby born dead delivered in a ditch by a prostitute, make the gruel thick and gooey.	0
that would be scann'd .	0
i hope that ,  after i tell you my news ,  you will think better of me .	0
will we be separated ?	0
what said he when he came unto himself ?	0
if you ever loved your poor dear father— oh god !	0
now all the blessings of a glad father are all around you !	0
what's this got to do with my lysander ?	0
i pray you ,  pass with your best violence .	0
what we will do ,  we do upon command .	0
from hamlet ?	0
i order you ,  get far away from me and do not haunt me thus .	0
i know it pleaseth neither of us well .	0
there lies your love .	0
a braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic!	0
son ,  i’ll be your half bianca comes .	0
my lord, my lord!	0
lie down right there .	0
hear me, good brother.	0
are you trying to remake me ?	0
she is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested.	0
yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which your prophet, the nazarite, conjured the devil into!	0
is she not down so late ,  or up so early ?	0
stay ,  lovely helena .	0
many a man would take you at your word and go indeed ,  having so good a mean .	0
bid her devise some means to come to confession this afternoon; and there she shall ,  at friar lawrence' cell ,  make her confession and married .	0
prithee ,  dispatch .	0
i go to take my stand to see him pass on to the capitol .	0
i'll keep my oath ,  patiently to bear my wroth .	0
isn’t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day i put it on ?	0
hie therefore ,  robin ,  overcast the night .	0
i'll fight until my flesh is hacked from my bones .	0
confess yourself to heaven ,  repent what's past ,  avoid what is to come ,  and don’t spread fertilizer on the weeds ,  to make them more rotten .	0
what quality is that ,  my lord ?	0
sir ?	0
she has light by her continually; it is her command .	0
do you honestly think—tell me ,  emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ?	0
please ,  try to act a little more serious ,  or the people in belmont will get the wrong impression about me ,  and your wildness will make me blow my chance with portia .	0
why is your cheek so pale ?	0
your honor is very welcome .	0
he's loved of the distracted multitude, who like not in their judgment, but their eyes; and where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd, but never the offence.	0
is it his habit?	0
she’ll confirm everything .	0
my hands are of your color ,  but i shame to wear a heart so white .	0
his ship is heavily timbered ,  and his captain is very experienced and has a good reputation; therefore my hopes ,  not excessively fed to death ,  stand in heavy anxiety .	0
now you and i have a new friendship, and will solemnly dance in duke theseus' house triumphantly, tomorrow at midnight and bless it for all fair prosperity.	0
if you sink ,  you’re dragging love down .	0
but nature should bring forth of its own kind all foison ,  all abundance ,  to feed my innocent people .	0
mercutio, you hang out with romeo, hang out!	0
go ,  captain ,  from me greet the danish king .	0
ambassadors of harry ,  king of england ,  request a hearing with your majesty .	0
amen to that !	0
i do believe 'twas he .	0
ay ,  darn it ,  you must because you must understand he only goes to see a noise that he heard ,  and will come again .	0
ha ?	0
most miserable hour that e'er time saw in lasting labor of his pilgrimage .	0
for, sir, it is as sure as you are roderigo, were i the moor, i would not be iago.	0
and you’re covered in blood?	0
what ,  i will be jovial .	0
i have long thought i would see this morning's face ,  and does it give me such a sight as this ?	0
so be careful .	0
very likely; one of them is a plain fish ,  and ,  no doubt ,  marketable .	0
well ,  tell me now about the lady ,  the one you swore to make a secret trip to ,  the one you promised to tell me about today ?	0
i will not fail you.	0
you don’t pray well.	0
i’m sorry i was so wrong about him .	0
you’re kidding !	0
hitting his wife ?	0
we'll burn his body in the holy place and with the brands fire the traitors' houses.	0
unhappy fortune !	0
pox ,  leave thy damnable faces ,  and begin !	0
stand here ,  make a good show on ’t .	0
and i saw her do it .	0
where's satisfaction ?	0
excuse me ,  sir ,  do you know how to read ?	0
your lordship speaks most truly of him .	0
stop right now or i’ll throw your dagger over the roof .	0
fool ,  of thyself speak well .	0
don’t do it with poison .	0
the messenger came on my guard ,  and at thy tent is now unloading of his mules .	0
your houses !	0
what, man!	0
poor man !	0
uncle ,  this man is a montague—our enemy .	0
i am content .	0
o mistress ,  villainy hath made mocks with love !	0
my dear caius ,  i’ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to .	0
this is what happens when you visit whores .	0
let any man perish who isn’t ready now !	0
you do not mind the play .	0
either my eyesight is failing me ,  or you look pale .	0
he’s not sick ,  my lord ,  unless it’s in his mind; but he’s not well ,  unless in his mind; his letter there will show you his state of affairs .	0
and let me kill cassio .	0
with the permission of brutus and the others—for brutus is an honorable man; they are all honorable men—i have come here to speak at caesar’s funeral .	0
i have the authority to dismiss this court ,  unless bellario comes today .	0
then meet me forthwith at the notary's; give him direction for this merry bond ,  and i will go and purse the ducats straight; see to my house ,  left in the fearful guard of an unthrifty knave; and presently i will be with you .	0
go thy ways ,  wench; serve god .	0
show me .	0
to bear all smooth and even, this sudden sending him away must seem deliberate pause.	0
if this prove a vision of the island ,  one dear son shall i twice lose .	0
well ,  jove ,  not i ,  is the doer of this ,  and he is to be thanked .	0
who could have restrained himself ,  who loved duncan and had the courage to act on it ?	0
farewell to the plumed forces and the big wars that make ambition a virtue !	0
faith, here's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale, who committed treason enough for god's sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven.	0
but ,  alas ,  caesar must bleed for it !	0
three thousand dollars - i think i may take his promise to pay.	0
ay ,  marry ,  is't; but to my mind ,  though i am native here and to the manner born ,  it is a custom more honour'd in the breach than the observance .	0
something is rotten in the state of denmark.	0
pass on the command to halt !	0
why ,  would not you ?	0
for us ,  we will resign during the life of this old majesty to him our absolute power .	0
o, she is ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed, and he's composed of harshness.	0
the hearts of old gave hands; but our new heraldry is hands ,  not hearts .	0
it is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb .	0
your lordship is right welcome back to denmark .	0
what grows of it ,  no matter .	0
how many goodly creatures are there here!	0
my noble girls !	0
how much does he owe the jew ?	0
tis for the dead ,  not for the quick .	0
if you have lost him: why, i have lost him too.	0
there he is at the window .	0
thou'lt be afraid to hear it .	0
all this done, repair to pompey's porch, where you shall find us.	0
wilt thou not answer ,  man ?	0
thy reason ,  man ?	0
nurse !	0
none can be called deformed but the unkind .	0
i always loved you ,  hermia; always kept your counsels; never wronged you; except that ,  because of my love for demetrius ,  i told him of your running away into this forest .	0
thus has he—and many more of the same bevy that i know the drossy age dotes on—only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter ,  a kind of yesty collection ,  which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial ,  the bubbles are out .	0
let’s go to our bedroom.	0
it ‘s a pity of him.	0
truly ,  sir ,  in respect of a fine workman ,  i am but ,  as you would say ,  a cobbler .	0
come on ,  sir andrew .	0
oh, jew!	0
i hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !	0
we know you have a job to do ,  brakenbury ,  and we’ll do what you say .	0
know that it was he, in the times past, which held you so under fortune, which you thought had been our innocent self?	0
believe me ,  i had rather have lost my purse full of crusadoes .	0
could beauty ,  my lord ,  have better dealings than with sincerity ?	0
let hercules himself do what he may ,  the cat will mew and every dog will have his day .	0
here will we sit ,  and let the sounds of music creep in our ears; soft stillness ,  and the night ,  become the touches of sweet harmony .	0
but goodbye .	0
what is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?	0
is it so nominated in the bond?	0
and she's fair who i love .	0
and then, of so gentle a disposition!	0
i will withdraw, but this intrusion shall, now seeming sweet, convert to bitter acid.	0
either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .	0
the queen and her elves will be here soon .	0
where have you been ,  my bravery ?	0
i forgot.	0
four legs and two voices—a most delicate monster .	0
will she go now to bed?	0
my lord, i have.	0
no ,  if without more words you will get you hence .	0
why, what's the matter?	0
i love thee well in that thou lik’st it not .	0
i'll silence me even here.	0
pray you ,  leave your courtesy ,  good monsieur .	0
welcome from mantua .	0
what, ho!	0
to relate the manner were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer, to add the death of you.	0
is the duke of exeter safe ?	0
i commend my duty to your lordship.	0
the charm’s going to bring things to a head .	0
therefore the sadness is without limit .	0
this cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen .	0
a thousand times the worse for me ,  to want your light !	0
how silent is this town !	0
draw together, and when i rear my hand, do you the like, to fall it on gonzalo.	0
o ,  answer me !	0
well ,  if it wasn’t her ,  i don’t know .	0
you’d be wiser and look better if you told all this to the doctor, because for me to try to purge him of anger would probably make him more angry.	0
you will lose this wager ,  my lord .	0
you wouldn’t have dared to tempt him so .	0
who calls ?	0
and where’s cordelia ? — do you see this ,  kent ?	0
this island belongs to me because sycorax ,  my mother ,  left it to me .	0
mark it ,  horatio .	0
my mistress with a monster is in love .	0
i never charge interest.	0
a witty if a cynical reply .	0
hey ,  nurse !	0
with no more ceremony than that ?	0
for what, i pray thee?	0
i do beseech you ,  sir ,  have patience .	0
what said he ?	0
i hope demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !	0
enter, sir, the castle.	0
my lord !	0
twenty crowns ?	0
he’s his mother’s child from head to toe .	0
who greets me so early in the morning ?	0
farewell ,  sweet masters both .	0
i will get peter quince to write a ballad of this dream.	0
here come the lovers ,  full of joy and mirth . — joy ,  gentle friends !	0
why may not imagination trace the noble dust of alexander till he find it stopping a bung - hole ?	0
what do you think of his neighbor ,  the scottish lord ?	0
it’ll be to our advantage more than doing us harm.	0
wilt thou be gone?	0
i beg you to pay a visit right away to my son ,  who’s changed too much .	0
i ,  wall ,  have done my part .	0
pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but give me your blessing; i am launcelot, your boy that was, your son that is, your child that shall be.	0
she unfaithful with cassio !	0
mother, for love of grace, don’t put that flattering oil on your soul that says my craziness speaks and not your sin.	0
i marry her!	0
so the cooks who can’t lick their fingers aren’t hired .	0
jove shield thee well for this!	0
you peers ,  continue this united league .	0
when only one or two men have all the good manners ,  and even they are dirty ,  things are bad .	0
will he tell us what this show meant ?	0
i pray you call them in .	0
look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patens of bright gold .	0
hence ,  horrible shadow !	0
in cases of defense ’tis best to weigh the enemy more mighty than he seems .	0
i'll get me to a place with more space ,  and there speak to great caesar as he comes along .	0
i have them ready.	0
he sleeps all day like a cat .	0
what if she is beautiful and foolish ?	0
it isn’t night whenever i see your face ,  so i don’t think it’s night ,  and this forest doesn’t lack worlds of company ,  for you ,  in my respect ,  are all the world .	0
is not that he ?	0
o gentle romeo, if you do love, pronounce it faithfully.	0
o, for a chair, to carry him easily from here!	0
i beyond all limit of what else i' th' world do love ,  prize ,  honor you .	0
what have you got there ?	0
by th' mass ,  and ’tis like a camel indeed .	0
the greatest is behind.	0
error in the bill ,  sir ,  error in the bill !	0
o my daughter ,  fled with a christian !	0
oh ,  and i know who loves him .	0
oh ,  damn her ,  damn her !	0
hurry . —oh ,  love ,  if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert i am at my craft .	0
a jealous hood ,  a jealous hood !	0
that will please god ,  who has him now .	0
a friend .	0
descend ,  for you must be my torchbearer .	0
farewell .	0
from hamlet !	0
i humbly thank your ladyship.	0
take the hint which my despair proclaims .	0
i’ll put a girdle round about the earth in forty minutes .	0
on tuesday last ,  a falcon ,  towering in her pride of place ,  was hawked at and killed by an owl that usually eats mice .	0
these kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men ,  flattering them into turning roman law into children’s games .	0
well ,  my good fellows ,  wait on me tonight .	0
what if she is beautiful and foolish?	0
have you not dropped from heaven?	0
i won’t take it .	0
he was quick mettle when he went to school.	0
caesar speaks .	0
here comes a messenger .	0
please ,  sir ,  i beg you .	0
a kind good - night to all !	0
you have been talk'd of since your travel much, and that in hamlet's hearing, for a quality wherein they say you shine.	0
farewell: i'll grow a talker for this gear.	0
lysander!	0
i see two husbands ,  or mine eyes deceive me .	0
so i am—to let him live .	0
peace!	0
he ,  he ,  ’tis he .	0
since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear; which is—no, no—which was the fairest dame that lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with cheer.	0
so it should be ,  that none but antony should conquer antony ,  but woe ’tis so !	0
i'll be an auditor; an actor too perhaps ,  if i see cause .	0
o ,  look !	0
again !	0
we doubt it nothing .	0
in good time !	0
i don’t doubt it, and all these sorrows shall become sweet memories that we can talk about in our future.	0
we should have else desired your good advice, which still hath been both grave and prosperous in this day's council; but we'll take tomorrow.	0
o, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!	0
oh ,  immortal gods !	0
are his wits safe ?	0
my lord ?	0
with him out of venice ,  i can make whatever bargains i want when i lend money . —go ,  tubal .	0
o child !	0
you told a lie; an stinking, damned lie; on my soul, a lie; a wicked lie.	0
you have loved him well; he hath not touch'd you yet .	0
alas ,  i sent you money to redeem you by dromio here ,  who came in haste for it .	0
no ,  not until we see a hot january .	0
for mine own part ,  no offence to the general nor any man of quality ,  i hope to be saved .	0
a mischievous child .	0
howe'er thou art a fiend ,  a woman’s shape doth shield thee .	0
did he ask about me ?	0
young prince edward is still alive—what do you think i’m going to say next ?	0
but don’t go to my uncle's bed ,  act as though you have a virtue if you don’t have it .	0
but you should think that we don’t come to offend, but with good will.	0
what we do we have been commanded to do .	0
this cannot anger him .	0
cleopatra— think you there was or might be such a man as this i dreamt of ?	0
beware the ides of march .	0
good - bye ,  my lord .	0
oh ,  deadly sin !	0
now he denies it faintly and laughs it out.	0
a thing for me ?	0
are you going to provoke me ?	0
bear me forthwith unto his creditor ,  and ,  knowing how the debt grows ,  i will pay it . — good master doctor ,  see him safe conveyed home to my house .	0
madam ,  you must come to your uncle .	0
how are my old friends from this island doing ? —honey ,  they’ll love you here in cyprus .	0
how am i false ?	0
a beautiful woman !	0
fit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special rule, that you don’t overstep the simplicity of being natural, for anything so overdone is not the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as it were, the mirror up to nature, to show truth in reality, scorn her falseness, and his form and force to the very age and body of the time.	0
if thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument; i'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.	0
but if	0
and why should caesar be a tyrant then ?	0
until then ,  enough .	0
freedom ,  high day !	0
i would rip his heart out in public and eat it .	0
o bloody period!	0
no ,  not a sad song .	0
o all you host of heaven!	0
well ,  well ,  you have a careful father ,  child .	0
i don’t like the job; but ,  since i am entered already so far into this cause ,  encouraged to it by foolish honesty and love ,  i will go on .	0
and we mean well, in going to this masquerade; but it’s no great sport to go.	0
but i don’t worry about being deceived because i don’t need to trust .	0
i remember him well; and i remember him worthy of thy praise.	0
farewell.	0
all you gods ,  in general meeting ,  take away her power ,  break all the spokes and curved rims from her wheel ,  and bowl the hub of the wheel down the hill of heaven ,  as low as you can to kill the fiends !	0
therefore give out you are of epidamnum ,  lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .	0
beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .	0
tis the last service that i shall command you .	0
didn’t he say my brother has run away ?	0
go ask .	0
i know you what you are ,  and like a sister am most loath to call your faults as they are named .	0
speak ,  nephew .	0
the one is too like an image and says nothing ,  and the other too like my lady’s eldest son ,  evermore tattling .	0
her vestal livery is but sick and green, and none but fools do wear it.	0
no ,  i must let them find me .	0
just as antony loves .	0
not dead?	0
divide each man into a thousand ,  and there you will have an imaginary army .	0
no way but this, killing myself, to die upon a kiss.	0
some tardy cripple must have taken the counter - order ,  who came after clarence was already buried .	0
he hath a heart as sound as a bell ,  and his tongue is the clapper ,  for what his heart thinks ,  his tongue speaks .	0
your lives are over .	0
i always loved you .	0
but i’m sorry—i’m not allowed to let you visit them .	0
happy be theseus, our renowned duke!	0
tybalt wanted to kill you ,  but you killed tybalt .	0
a man that all his life has founded his good fortunes on your love, shared dangers with you, the handkerchief!	0
i think thou dost; and for i know thou'rt full of love and honesty and weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath ,  therefore these stops of thine fright me the more; for such things in a false disloyal knave are tricks of custom; but in a man that's just they're close dilations ,  working from the heart ,  that passion cannot rule .	0
in that case ,  i think cassio’s an honest man .	0
how goes it ,  friend eros ?	0
stand not amaz'd .	0
they lie in bed while they dream about the truth .	0
now from head to foot i’m as firm as marble .	0
i can’t report more of this matter, but men are men; the best sometimes forget themselves.	0
let him command ,  and to obey shall be in me remorse ,  what bloody business ever .	0
you’d better shut up !	0
and though we lay these honors on this man to ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads ,  he shall but bear them as the ass bears gold ,  to groan and sweat under the business ,  either led or driven ,  as we point the way .	0
what is her mother ?	0
i am not drunk now; i can stand well enough ,  and i speak well enough .	0
get out, dog!	0
thou liest; thou canst not .	0
transparent helena!	0
i have done no harm.	0
this will keep them from being frightened .	0
would you rather that caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves ,  or that caesar were dead and we all lived as free men ?	0
no, i promise you; i won’t risk my reputation so stupidly.	0
is all of this about your father ?	0
the earth sings when he touches it .	0
but herein mean i to enrich my pain ,  to have his sight thither and back again .	0
there is scorn and disdain in her eyes ,  and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .	0
what man is there so very unreasonable ,  that ,  if you had bothered to defend it with any terms of earnestness ,  lacked the modesty to encourage the thing be held as a ceremony ?	0
by heaven ,  i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts that oft i have endured .	0
what a strange drowsiness possesses them !	0
why ,  i have eat none yet .	0
me ,  uncle ?	0
i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea ,  which if thou follow ,  this strict court of venice must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there .	0
but she ,  your subject ,  hates such a king .	0
to think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you.	0
are we all ready ?	0
with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass .	0
what is amiss?	0
why, i were best to cut my left hand off and swear i lost the ring defending it.	0
if he has a face like yours ,  a good scratching couldn’t make him look any worse .	0
give me only one evil enemy at a time ,  and i'll fight their legions again and again .	0
can he even get angry ?	0
how purposed, sir, i pray you?	0
it’s since the wedding of lucentio, come pentecost as quickly as it will, it’s some five-and-twenty years since we masked.	0
i’m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .	0
curse you for your false appearances !	0
give me my amour.	0
awake, dear heart, awake!	0
what's the matter with thee now?	0
come.	0
i am not “i,” if there be such an “i,” or those eyes shut that make you answer “i.” if he is slain, say “i;” or if not, say “no.” brief sounds determine my wealth or sorrows.	0
not from his mouth ,  had it the ability of life to thank you .	0
the carriages, sir, are the hangers.	0
if you pursue it ,  this strict court of venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there .	0
passion !	0
asses are made to bear ,  and so are you .	0
lysander ,  speak again !	0
hortensio	0
only too well .	0
the potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit .	0
what was it ?	0
and therefore ,  as a stranger ,  welcome it .	0
to alonso] it is foul weather in us all, good sir, [to alonso] it is foul weather in us all, good sir, when you are cloudy.	0
the wager ?	0
yes ,  my lord ,  just as long as you don’t ask me to forget about it .	0
a nice stool .	0
indeed ,  my lord ,  it followed hard upon .	0
don’t talk to me ,  emilia; i cannot weep ,  and i don’t have any answers ,  except what should go by water .	0
those guards that macbeth has slain .	0
it’s true .	0
look ,  here it is .	0
and have you mercy too !	0
to adrian] but the rarity of it is ,  which is indeed [to adrian] but the rarity of it is ,  which is indeed almost beyond credit— [to antonio] as many vouched rarities are .	0
avoid what is to come .	0
if it will please caesar to be so good to caesar as to hear what i have to say ,  i shall beg him to take care of himself .	0
ah ,  ha !	0
madam ,  you have to go to your uncle’s .	0
some are born great— ”	0
think, my lord!	0
i hope i enjoy wearing it ,  for my heart is very heavy .	0
call ,  good mercutio .	0
no ,  not at all .	0
here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears .	0
he’s welcome too .	0
a man with a wife like that might ask ,   “ hey ,  wandering wit ,  where are you off to ?  ”  nah ,  better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor’s bed .	0
well too .	0
now to my word: it is ‘adieu ,  adieu !	0
i could not forget you ,  for i never saw you before in all my life .	0
come ,  let's go; all the strangers are gone .	0
but i’m as immovable as the northern star ,  whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky .	0
by heaven, i love thee better than myself, for i come hither arm'd against myself.	0
the ropes that romeo asked you to fetch?	0
these foils have all a length ?	0
no ,  sir ,  there are more with him .	0
and even though nature has given us the wit to have this argument ,  hasn’t fortune sent this fool here to stop us ?	0
a thousand ,  sir ,  early though ’t be ,  have on their riveted trim and at the port expect you .	0
not even a hair died; not a spot on their clothing ,  but fresher than they were before ,  and ,  as you ordered me ,  i have dispersed them in groups around the island .	0
let them curtsy with their left legs ,  and not presume to touch a hair of my master’s horse - tail till they kiss their hands .	0
any man can get drunk sometime .	0
yes ,  you’re absolutely right about how worthy brutus is and how much we need him .	0
in england this strange monster would be just like a man .	0
no ,  not a whit .	0
the french have retreated ,  see ,  and there were great acts of courage .	0
still thou mistakest, or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.	0
it is a quick lie ,  sir ,  it will go away again from me to you .	0
you know the rendezvous.	0
edward’s sons have been carried off by the angels and anne ,  my wife ,  has bid good night to the world .	0
fair is foul, and foul is fair.	0
heaven is here ,  where juliet lives ,  and every cat ,  and dog ,  and little mouse ,  every unworthy thing ,  live here in heaven ,  and may look on her; but romeo may not .	0
follow me then .	0
the boy was the very support of my age, my very prop.	0
no!	0
that 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts .	0
o ,  balmy breath ,  that dost almost persuade justice to break her sword !	0
or should i describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?	0
kill !	0
pretty too !	0
tomorrow ,  then ,  i judge a happy day .	0
i am cinna the poet, i am cinna the poet.	0
it is an honor that i dream not of .	0
give me thy hand ,  and let me see thee in thy woman’s weeds .	0
what is the matter, think you?	0
in the high and mighty roman empire ,  just before the emperor julius caesar was assassinated ,  corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of rome speaking gibberish .	0
at this hour lie at my mercy all mine enemies .	0
i’m glad that my weak words have brought out this show of fire from brutus.	0
good sir, be a man; think every bearded fellow that's but yoked may draw with you.	0
tell me ,  thou unknown power—      he knows thy thought .	0
it shall be said his judgement ruled our hands; our youths and wildness shall no whit appear ,  but all be buried in his gravity .	0
and i .	0
nor know i aught by me that's said or done amiss this night; unless self - charity be sometimes a vice ,  and to defend ourselves it be a sin when violence assails us .	0
of your philosophy you make no use, if you give place to accidental evils.	0
the duke and senators of venice greet you .	0
his heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights ,  but now he’s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an egyptian whore .	0
if she convey letters to richmond ,  you shall answer it .	0
titinius ,  if thou lovest me ,  mount thou my horse ,  and hide thy spurs in him till he have brought thee up to yonder troops and here again ,  that i may rest assured whether yond troops are friend or enemy .	0
no ,  hath not ?	0
the queen his mother lives almost by his looks ,  and for myself ,  whether it’s my virtue or my plague ,  she's so necessary to my life and soul ,  that ,  as the star moves only in his orbit ,  i couldn’t do anything without her say - so .	0
i’ll have to tell the story again every month ,  since you seem to forget it .	0
he did me kindness ,  sir ,  drew on my side ,  but in conclusion put strange speech upon me .	0
and hell gnaw his bones!	0
when shall he come?	0
you elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves; and you that chase the ebbing ocean on the sands without leaving a foot print, and run from him when he comes back; you half-puppets that make the green ringlets sour by moonshine, where the ewe doesn’t bite; and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrooms that are happy to hear the curfew sound; by whose aid,— weak masters though you are,—i have dimmed the noontide sun, called the mutinous winds, and set roaring between the green sea and the blue sky: i haven given fire to the dreaded rattling thunder, and split jove's stout oak with his own lightning bolt: i have made the strong-based land that stuck out into the ocean shake; and plucked up the pine and cedar by the roots: at my command, graves have awakened the dead, opened the coffins, and let them walk out by my so powerful magic.	0
why ,  sir ,  what’s your conceit in that ?	0
but i will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece ,  and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father’s sake .	0
ay ,  go your ways ,  go your ways .	0
it is time i should tell you more.	0
call my sister so .	0
are they so followed ?	0
oh ,  damn her ,  damn her !	0
what does he say about brutus ?	0
why ,  ay .	0
i doubt some danger does approach you nearly .	0
how well my comfort is reviv'd by this!	0
no, it begins again.	0
there i’ll see only myself .	0
give me bianca for my inheritance .	0
come, get ready.	0
all this can i truly deliver.	0
that’s true.	0
damn him !	0
it seems to me that yet we sleep ,  we dream .	0
hold ,  my hand .	0
caesar’s speed defies belief .	0
i will set down what she says ,  to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly .	0
shut that ,  and ’twill out at the keyhole .	0
ah me!	0
we shall have old swearing that they gave the rings away to men; but we'll confront them, and outswear them too.	0
fool ,  do not flatter yourself .	0
now ,  sir ,  judge it for yourself whether or i am better suited in any beautiful terms to love the moor .	0
brutus and caesar—what should be in that  “ caesar ”  ?	0
exactly like that .	0
what handkerchief?	0
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips ,  i will appear in blood .	0
he’s, in his retirement to bed, exceedingly upset.	0
no ,  truly not ,  although until last night i have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow .	0
to sebastian] if but one of his pockets could speak ,  [to sebastian] if but one of his pockets could speak ,  would it not say he lies ?	0
no, my good lord, but, as you did command, i did reject his letters and denied his access to me.	0
please do ,  madam .	0
why ,  so didst thou .	0
here we .	0
think, my lord?	0
go ,  vanish into air ,  away !	0
i gave him no order .	0
what is thy will with her ?	0
and though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours ,  when they plummet ,  they plummet that much farther .	0
if we are like you in the rest ,  we will resemble you in that .	0
what kind of god art thou ,  that suffer’st more of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?	0
tut ,  i am in their bosoms ,  and i know wherefore they do it .	0
seven days and nights?	0
my ears haven’t yet heard a hundred words of that tongue's speech, and yet i know the sound; aren’t you romeo, and a montague?	0
he's for a jig or a dirty tale, or he sleeps.	0
hence will i to my ghostly father's cell ,  his help to crave and my dear hap to tell .	0
prove true ,  imagination ,  oh ,  prove true ,  that i ,  dear brother ,  be now ta'en for you !	0
but then i saw no harm, and then i heard each syllable that breath made up between them.	0
tell me ,  do i have your consent to kill them ?	0
first, noble friend, let me embrace you, whose honor can’t be measured or confined.	0
o god ,  she comes !	0
i beg you .	0
why, look you, how you storm!	0
you need to leave to take care of your own business .	0
right now i’d give a thousand	0
i but believe it partly ,  for i am fresh of spirit and resolved to meet all perils very constantly .	0
i long to hear the story of your life ,  which must affect the ear strangely .	0
brutus ,  and caesar: what should be in that caesar ?	0
my lord ,  i don’t know what’s going on ,  but it seems to me that your highness isn’t being treated as politely as before .	0
what’s this ?	0
fare you well.	0
if you are a devil ,  i won’t be able to kill you .	0
o, wonderful!	0
here ,  bashful cunning !	0
the king ,  sir— ay ,  sir ,  what of him ?	0
what, ho!	0
it is the bright day that brings forth the adder and that craves wary walking .	0
provoke him so that he will; because even out of that ,  i will make these men of cyprus rebel ,  whose character won’t come back to their original calmness unless cassio is replaced .	0
o my sweet ,  i prattle out of fashion ,  and i dote in mine own comforts .	0
she gave it to him ,  and he gave it to his whore .	0
what other bonds than secret romans, that have spoken the word, and will not negotiate without honor?	0
though our lives— your spirits shine through you .	0
what do you mean by this haunting of me?	0
it used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .	0
a bastard, crazy fellow's it was.	0
let’s go.	0
down with the montagues !	0
why ,  then ,  i care not for thee .	0
but even so ,  i’ll make doubly sure .	0
come with me and i’ll get it for you .	0
why doesn’t then make our eyelids close ?	0
have you pray'd tonight ,  desdemona ?	0
knock, knock, knock.	0
a braggart ,  a rogue ,  a villain ,  that fights by the book of arithmetic !	0
romeo, good night.	0
i die an innocent death.	0
no, caesar doesn’t have it; but you, and i, and honest casca, we have epilepsy.	0
we age and die because they wear us out .	0
i shall forget ,  to have thee still stand there ,  remembering how i love thy company .	0
do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?	0
more ,  please ,  more .	0
o ,  wonder !	0
that  “ may be ”  must be ,  love ,  on thursday .	0
ay ,  my lord ,  and of calveskins too .	0
the air smells light and sweet to our gentle senses.	0
o romeo ,  romeo !	0
i have ,  when you’ve heard what i can say and you know it now .	0
o masters ,  if i were disposed to stir your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage ,  i should do brutus wrong ,  and cassius wrong— who ,  you all know ,  are honorable men .	0
sir ,  i commend you to your own content .	0
do you find your patience so predominant in your nature that you can let this go ?	0
no, the clock has already struck twelve.	0
tybalt, the kinsman to old capulet, hath sent a letter to his father's house.	0
one heart ,  one bed ,  two bosoms ,  and one troth .	0
how i adore on you!	0
by gis and by saint charity, alack, and fie for shame!	0
good friends ,  go in and taste some wine with me .	0
i’ll wait upon your lordship .	0
i'll put another question to thee .	0
how now !	0
madman!	0
what, are you busy, hello?	0
then bid them prepare dinner.	0
your grace heard their saccharine words ,  but didn’t take note of their poisonous intentions .	0
no more of that.	0
and i ,  my lord .	0
madam ?	0
ring the alarum bell .	0
give him this letter .	0
they say they have letters for you.	0
most lamentable day, most woeful day that ever ever i did yet behold!	0
if a christian did not play the knave and get thee ,  i am much deceived .	0
let him be caesar.	0
this to be true i do engage my life .	0
please, let’s go and find out where he is, and help burn up his tangled depression with some delight or other.	0
oh ,  shut up .	0
were it not better ,  because that i am more than common tall ,  that i did suit me all points like a man ?	0
give every man thy ear but few thy voice .	0
tybalt is gone, and romeo banished; romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.	0
this island's mine, through sycorax my mother, which you took from me.	0
all for your delight we are not here.	0
now he urges him to tell it again.	0
but now ,  my lord .	0
why ,  that were covetousness .	0
moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel moor; so come my soul to bliss, as i speak true; so speaking as i think, i die, i die.	0
mark the music .	0
i will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger.	0
do you think so ?	0
if things go well ,  bring the crowd to  i’m off .	0
where hast thou been ,  my heart ?	0
so again ,  goodnight .	0
i’d be ashamed to give you this .	0
if any man doubt that ,  let him put me to my purgation .	0
mine too . —are you listening ,  monster ?	0
if you say so ,  i hope you will not kill me .	0
i’ll send a man to mantua ,  where that exiled rogue is living .	0
he can report, as seemeth by his plight, of the revolt the newest state.	0
as woman’s love .	0
now do i see 'tis true .	0
her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often ,  continually asking me about my life and all the battles i’ve fought .	0
my niece is already in the belief that he’s mad .	0
say again ,  where didst thou leave these varlets ?	0
here ,  madam ,  at your service .	0
she sent dromio to bring you home for lunch .	0
stars ,  my lord .	0
sir ,  here’s the queen .	0
ha !	0
some such squire he was that turn'd your wit the seamy side without, and made you to suspect me with the moor.	0
the soul and body rive not more in parting than greatness going off .	0
my wife killed too ?	0
the rest will comfort ,  for thy counsel’s sound .	0
listen to me ,  because i will speak .	0
so much for this, sir.	0
gentlemen ,  my master antonio is at his house ,  and desires to speak with you both .	0
ingratitude is always hideous ,  but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !	0
you may do what you want to ,  but i say he's a tried and valiant soldier .	0
dolabella !	0
we're going to church tomorrow.	0
yes ,  being kept together and put to use .	0
as i was working on one musty room ,  the prince and claudio entered .	0
i have bankrupted three tailors .	0
caesar ,  i’m telling you that antony is dead .	0
nay ,  indeed if you had your eyes ,  you might fail of the knowing me .	0
how didst thou know 'twas she?	0
have you heard any imputation to the contrary ?	0
i’ll cross it though it blast me . —stay ,  illusion !	0
my lord ,  i wish thursday were tomorrow .	0
tis new to thee.	0
if we imagine no worse of them than they imagine of themselves, they may pass for excellent men.	0
be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .	0
with this i avoid the grief of antony’s death .	0
is it a custom ?	0
and why should caesar be a tyrant then ?	0
i’m coming in peace .	0
what ,  have you lost your wits ?	0
fill your purse with money .	0
if it please you .	0
i thank your honour . —for my part ,  my lord ,  my purpose was not to have seen you here; but meeting with salerio by the way ,  he did entreat me ,  past all saying nay ,  to come with him along .	0
what manners is in this ,  to press before thy father to a grave ?	0
hadst thou done so ,  the kings that have revolted ,  and the soldier that has this morning left thee ,  would have still followed thy heels .	0
i bet i’ve been wrong about myself all this time .	0
what needs this iterance ,  woman ?	0
but i would kill you by petting you too much .	0
your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun .	0
yes ,  indeed .	0
upon the right hand i ,  keep thou the left .	0
being done ,  there is no pause .	0
you must to parthia .	0
first he denied you had in him no right .	0
i know that we shall have him well to friend .	0
o woeful day !	0
run ,  master ,  run .	0
what news ?	0
swear .	0
and the best of me is diligence .	0
come along with me .	0
right now ,  i would give a 220 , 000 yards of sea for an acre of bare ground; a long wasteland ,  brown brush ,  anything .	0
why, the honest men.	0
in the secret parts of fortune?	0
in such a night to shut me out !	0
i know thee ,  roderigo .	0
what did you mean by that same handkerchief you just gave me?	0
good maria ,  let this fellow be looked to .	0
a trade, sir, that, i hope, i may use with a safe con- science, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.	0
i have heard my father name him .	0
what love could press lysander from my side ?	0
yes ,  your highness .	0
i am glad on't; i desire no more delight, than to be under sail and gone to-night.	0
a friend ?	0
this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchre .	0
i heard the news ,  my lord .	0
there are some harsh contents in that letter that steal the color from bassanio's cheeks: some dear friend is dead, or nothing else in the world could change the constitution so much of any constant man.	0
why ,  and i trust i may go too ,  may i not ?	0
he hath not yet made wan -  ton the night with her ,  and she is sport for jove .	0
the single and peculiar life is bound with all the strength and armour of the mind to keep itself from noyance; but much more that spirit upon whose weal depends and rests the lives of many .	0
a most poor man made tame to fortune’s blows ,  who by the art of known and feeling sorrows am pregnant to good pity .	0
farewell ,  my coz .	0
well said ,  old mole !	0
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief ?	0
they were traitors .	0
art thou contented ,  jew ?	0
what would he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that i have?	0
what should i do ?	0
tis certain ,  every man that dies ill ,  the ill upon his own head .	0
i’ll cross it, though it kill me.	0
and that’s how you must take your husbands .	0
i swear by my sword— swear by your shield ,  too !	0
saddle up my horses .	0
alack, what noise is this?	0
i’ll back to the duke of gloucester and tell him so .	0
why the wrong is but a wrong i' th' world ,  and having the world for your labor ,  ’tis a wrong in your own world ,  and you might quickly make it right .	0
and now, good friends, as you are friends, scholars, and soldiers, give me one poor request.	0
were ’t my fitness to let these hands obey my blood ,  they are apt enough to dislocate and tear thy flesh and bones .	0
yet caesar shall go forth, for these predictions are to the world in general as to caesar.	0
so will it ,  madam till i lie with you .	0
is it two days ago since i tripped up thy heels and beat thee before the king ?	0
would he not be a comfort to our travel ?	0
on this hill and in despair ,  with his slave pindarus .	0
i am none of his flirt - gills .	0
claim fair england’s peace depends on this alliance .	0
so haply slander whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, as level as the cannon to his blank, transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name and hit the woundless air.—o, come away!	0
i will not fail.	0
you were kneeled to and otherwise begged by all of us; and the fair soul herself considered at which option she should take, between reluctance and obedience.	0
and this report has so exasperated the king that he prepares for some attempt of war.	0
but ,  i’ll warrant you ,  when i say so ,  she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .	0
are you really as in love as your poems declare ?	0
o julius caesar ,  you’re mighty yet !	0
a grave ?	0
well ,  well .	0
therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.	0
yield up, o love, thy crown and hearted throne to tyrannous hate!	0
let him bless thee too .	0
leave me alone to woo him .	0
i wish i were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!	0
father ,  ’tis thus: yourself and all the world that talked of her have talked amiss of her .	0
wow, she is one of this conspiracy!	0
sweet marjoram .	0
do you confess the promise to pay?	0
you’re wrong about that ,  i assure you .	0
but you’re wrong .	0
if we are slated to die ,  the fewer ,  the better for our country ,  and if we’re slated to live ,  the fewer men ,  the greater the share of honor for each of us .	0
my worthy lord, your noble friends are missing you.	0
say from whence you owe this strange intelligence ,  or why upon this blasted heath you stop our way with such prophetic greeting .	0
what do you want ?	0
o, pitiful day that i was ever born!	0
marry ,  you may partly hope that your father got you not ,  that you are not the jew's daughter .	0
you counterfeit, you puppet you!	0
yes ,  as kind as snow to a harvest .	0
and but i be deceived ,  signior baptista may remember me ,  near twenty years ago ,  in genoa ,  where we were lodgers at the pegasus .	0
to the gates of tartar ,  thou most excellent devil of wit !	0
he weeps for what is done.	0
throw your vile guesses into the devil's teeth ,  from where you got them .	0
pray god ,  i say ,  i prove a needless coward !	0
i aim'd so near when i suppos'd you lov'd .	0
gentle mercutio, put up your sword.	0
it is the east, and juliet is the sun rising!	0
if you will see it ,  follow me .	0
my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind, so flew'd, so sanded; and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew; crook-knee'd and dew-lapp'd like thessalian bulls; slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells, each under each.	0
the enemy’s losses have been very great ,  pretty substantial .	0
bianca’s love made me trade places with tranio while he masqueraded as me around town .	0
thou sayst his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings .	0
meantime ,  but think how i may do thee good ,  and be inheritor of thy desire .	0
what will i do ,  think’st thou ?	0
o ,  yes ,  my lord ,  but very idle words .	0
my friends told me as much ,  and i knew it ,  too .	0
give me that man that is not passion's slave ,  and i will wear him in my heart's core ,  ay ,  in my heart of heart ,  as i do thee .	0
is decius brutus and trebonius there ?	0
i’m a man ,  my lady ,  that god has made for himself to ruin .	0
my treasure has no boundaries ,  just like the sea ,  my love is as deep as the sea; the more i give to you ,  the more i have ,  for both my love and the sea are infinite .	0
when shall he come ?	0
since his majesty went into the field, i have seen her rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.	0
coming from sardis, on our former ensign two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd, gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands, who to philippi here consorted us.	0
pray you ,  away .	0
please ,  young man ,  don’t make me angry .	0
confusion now hath made his masterpiece.	0
a flatterer's would not, though they do appear as huge as high olympus.	0
good - bye .	0
your husband being troubled with a shrew measures my husband’s sorrow by his woe .	0
go thrust him out at gates ,  and let him smell his way to dover .	0
now ,  antony ,  our prayers are answered .	0
how did you know it was she?	0
and so do i .	0
please ,  will you take his arm ?	0
get up ,  liar .	0
see that it is done ,  and prepare a feast for the soldiers .	0
only i yield to die .	0
it waves me forward again .	0
it’s incredible—they didn’t say a word .	0
knock knock knock, knock, knock!	0
the  “ why ”  is plain as way to parish church: he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly ,  although he smart ,  not to seem senseless of the bob .	0
what ,  ho !	0
she always has to have a light next to her .	0
let me embrace the father of lucentio ,  and then we’ll journey on to see your son ,  who will rejoice at your arrival .	0
lady olivia will have you executed for not showing up .	0
i'll make my trip around the world in forty minutes .	0
tomorrow night at dinner then ?	0
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead .	0
what's hecuba to him ,  or he to hecuba ,  that he should weep for her ?	0
the ancient saying is no heresy .	0
now thou and i are new in amity ,  and will tomorrow midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus' house triumphantly ,  and bless it to all fair prosperity .	0
did god make him ?	0
do not say  “ banishment .  ”  hence from verona art thou banishèd .	0
the moor himself is still at sea .	0
truly, a great arithmetician, one michael cassio, a florentine, a fellow almost damned in a having a beautiful wife; that has never led a squadron in the field, and doesn’t know the division of a battle any more than a spinster does, unless the theory books, in which the consuls wearing togas can propose a plan as masterly as he can.	0
it should seem then that dobbin’s tail grows backward .	0
i won’t have one any bigger .	0
i see ,  sir ,  you are liberal in offers .	0
the ,  who took my letter to romeo ?	0
you’re right .	0
truly ,  and i hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow’s shadow .	0
love can make worthless things beautiful .	0
why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?	0
my lord ,  in athens .	0
ye men of cyprus ,  let her have your knees .	0
true ,  i talk of dreams ,  which are the children of an idle brain ,  born of nothing but vain fantasy; which is as thin of substance as the air ,  and more inconstant than the wind ,  who courts ,  even now ,  the frozen heart of the north ,  and ,  being angered ,  puffs away from there ,  turning his face to the dew - dropping south .	0
good fool ,  for my brother’s death .	0
then say at once what thou dost know in this .	0
but edward is still alive .	0
then we can all three be comrades on our way to france .	0
you don’t use your knowledge effectively ,  if you give into unexpected evil events .	0
speak to us .	0
tis to be doubted ,  madam .	0
the courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, the expectancy and rose of the fair state, the glass of fashion and the mould of form, the observed of all observers, quite, quite down!	0
make the rope of his hanging our rope for the anchor ,  because the one we have now does us little good !	0
i will hear that play, because nothing can ever be wrong when simpleness and duty give it freely.	0
why does he speak this to me whom he hates ?	0
therefore be merry ,  cassio ,  for thy solicitor shall rather die than give thy cause away .	0
ay ,  sir ,  it is too true ,  god help the while .	0
so is my horse, octavius, and for that, i appoint him keeper of the hay.	0
beware the thane of fife .	0
shall i not have just my principal?	0
no ,  he means you’ll use makeup when you’re old .	0
i’ve left our luggage on the ship ,  and i bought the oil ,  balm ,  and liquor you wanted .	0
o lamentable day!	0
my invocation is fair and honest ,  and ,  in his mistress' name ,  i only conjure him to raise up him .	0
good captain blunt ,  tell the earl goodnight from me ,  and tell him that by two in the morning i would like him to visit my tent .	0
thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft, and wit depends on dilatory time.	0
are you yet determined today to marry with my brother’s daughter ?	0
pray you ,  look in .	0
be gentle to her .	0
judge ,  o you gods ,  how dearly caesar loved him !	0
talkers are no good doers .	0
hie thee ,  slave .	0
it is for your ears only .	0
let’s follow .	0
you were best go in .	0
our reasons are so full of good regard that were you ,  antony ,  the son of caesar ,  you should be satisfied .	0
i’m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .	0
your plantain-leaf is excellent for that.	0
there the men are as mad as he .	0
i know it’s the sun that shines so bright .	0
amen!	0
come one ,  woman !	0
rarely ,  rarely .	0
this is a dear manikin to you ,  sir toby .	0
do so .	0
we will speak further .	0
when prospero is destroyed .	0
a fourth !	0
killing swine.	0
ok, i’ll say no more but to the problem.	0
he was quick mettle when he went to school .	0
mend me, you rude fellow!	0
well demanded, wench; my tale provokes that question.	0
o ,  farewell ,  farewell the neighing horse and the shrill trumpet ,  the spirit - stirring drum ,  the ear - piercing fife ,  the royal banner ,  and all goodness ,  pride ,  pomp ,  and circumstance of glorious war !	0
at crosby place ,  there shall you find us both .	0
it were well the general were put in mind of it .	0
he would make but a sport of it and torment the poor lady worse .	0
disgusting slave, in which any type of goodness won’t take hold, being capable of every evil!	0
sir ,  i lack advancement .	0
for the best turn i’ th’ bed .	0
let me yet know of you whither you are bound .	0
well ,  i wouldn’t want to undo the naughtiness ,  since the boy turned out so well .	0
what raiment will your honor wear today ?	0
heaven knows what secrets she’s keeping .	0
my dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?	0
goodbye .	0
where is metellus cimber?	0
we will behold his death .	0
you must therefore be content to conceal the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and violent expedition .	0
out ,  loathed medicine !	0
come on ,  men !	0
your mind may change .	0
i'll be thy second.	0
your reasons are too shallow and too quick .	0
that !	0
do so .	0
it’s nine o'clock .	0
yes .	0
do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust .	0
oh ,  what authority and show of truth can cunning sin cover itself withal !	0
what is thy name ?	0
tomorrow i intend to hunt again .	0
tell him i have moved my lord on his behalf ,  and hope all will be well .	0
this is your negligence.	0
stand ,  ho !	0
you are a fool . —you ,  niece ,  provide yourself .	0
shall i be tempted of the devil thus ?	0
tropically .	0
it is not lost; but what an if it were ?	0
fie ,  what a question’s that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter !	0
here's fine revolution ,  and we had the trick to see't .	0
iago beckons me .	0
he stays upon your will .	0
you spoke not with her since ?	0
a piece of him .	0
only how will you do for a father ?	0
what’s amazing is how long he lasted .	0
cry but ‘ay me!’ pronounce but ‘love’ and ‘dove’; speak to my gossip venus one fair word, one nickname for her purblind son and heir, young adam cupid, he that shot so trim when king cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!	0
the coroner has decided ,  and finds it christian burial .	0
are englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?	0
but aren’t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?	0
adieu .	0
mend when thou canst .	0
or stole it, rather.	0
but if you had to say something nice about me ,  what would you say ?	0
my will alone, nothing else in the world.	0
therefore ,  i beseech your highness pardon me .	0
isn’t it possible to understand in another tongue ?	0
what do you get to drink ,  instead of sweet obedience ,  but poisonous flattery ?	0
hast thou forgot her ?	0
get your apparel together; good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our play is preferred.	0
i’ve heard a lot more .	0
we ,  at the height ,  are ready to decline .	0
they are all forth; well, i will walk myself to county paris, to prepare him up against to-morrow.	0
they are free men ,  but i am banishèd .	0
signior gratiano?	0
but oh ,  how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness !	0
say you have wronged her ,  sir .	0
i'll not be made a soft and dull - ey'd fool ,  to shake the head ,  relent ,  and sigh ,  and yield to christian intercessors .	0
a southwest blow on ye and blister you all o'er !	0
what ,  should i stab him while he sleeps ?	0
be careful, fair maid.	0
lies all within . —deliver me the key .	0
of laertes?	0
she is dead.	0
he’s insane .	0
bring me no more reports; let them fly all!	0
note him ,  note him ,  good charmian ,  ’tis the man ,  but note him .	0
aren’t you the guy that scares the maidens of the village; skims cream from milk, and sometimes works the churn, and, bootless, makes the breathless housewife churn even harder; and sometimes makes the drink so that it doesn’t have a yeasty foam; misleads wanderers who are out at night, laughing at their getting lost?	0
and you shall speak in the same pulpit whereto i am going ,  after my speech is ended .	0
you shall have ransom .	0
tell me ,  good brutus ,  can you see your face ?	0
if i repeated it to you ,  it would kill you as soon as you heard it .	0
this was the most unkindest cut of all; for when the noble caesar saw him stab, ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, quite vanquish'd him.	0
o inhuman dog !	0
you’re less happy ,  being feared ,  than they are in fearing you .	0
it was a huge mistake to let old gloucester live after we blinded him .	0
let this be so .	0
me too ,  lord !	0
but, be careful that you don’t stay after the guards are in place, because then, you cannot get to mantua, where you shall live until we can find a time to publicize your marriage, reconcile your friends, beg pardon of the prince, and call you back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than you left here in grief.	0
that ?	0
behold ,  there stand the caskets ,  noble prince; if you choose that wherein i am contain'd ,  straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd; but if you fail ,  without more speech ,  my lord ,  you must be gone from hence immediately .	0
roderigo.	0
madam ,  i swear i use no clever words at all .	0
have you sent someone to bottom's house?	0
i’ve decided on a plan that doesn’t require your assistance .	0
we’ll go to supper i' th' morning .	0
i am true to my intentions; they follow the king's pleasure.	0
i am come to bid my king and master aye good night .	0
ay .	0
then your lips will feel them more quickly .	0
he was the first that ever bore arms .	0
let me but meet you ladies one hour hence ,  and i’ll salute your grace of york as mother and reverend looker - on ,  of two fair queens .	0
no ,  messala .	0
in that case ,  the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .	0
here in her hairs, the painter plays the spider; and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men, faster than gnats in cobwebs: but her eyes,— how could he see to do them?	0
i am not valiant neither ,  but every puny whipster gets my sword .	0
why ,  look ,  how you get angry !	0
i heard it not .	0
farewell ,  and let your haste commend your duty .	0
come ,  sir ,  you peevishly threw it to her ,  and her will is it should be so returned .	0
the food inside is warm ,  but you’re out here freezing .	0
oh ,  now you weep ,  and ,  i perceive ,  you feel the dint of pity .	0
poor bankrout ,  break at once !	0
hum, i have heard that guilty creatures, sitting at a play, have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that presently they have proclaim'd their malefactions; for murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ, i'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle.	0
o noble prince ,  i can discover all the unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .	0
alas, what cry is that?	0
i’ll wait for her here and when she comes i’ll take a novel approach with her .	0
o my sweet ,  i chit - chat unfashionably ,  and i talk foolishly about my own comforts .	0
where be these bloody thieves?	0
i’ll drink to her as long as there’s a hole in my throat and booze in illyria .	0
the ambassadors from norway ,  my good lord ,  are joyfully return'd .	0
murder’s always horrible ,  but this one was especially horrible ,  weird ,  and unnatural .	0
call you me daughter ?	0
i remember ,  one said there were no mixes in the lines to make the matter spicy ,  and no matter in the phrase that might accuse the author of putting on airs ,  but called it an honest effort ,  as wholesome as it was sweet ,  and ,  by very much ,  more handsome than fine .	0
it’s good you found me .	0
bless you ,  fair dame !	0
you’re a cobbler ,  are you ?	0
wake up ! — "  such instigations have often been dropped where i have picked them up .	0
what do you want ?	0
thou fond mad man ,  hear me a little speak .	0
go ,  some of you; whoe'er you find attach .	0
no .	0
what do you think ?	0
i cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond .	0
richard .	0
wait .	0
yes ,  that’s true .	0
tell me why .	0
we have to take the king’s side .	0
have we turned to turks, and do to ourselves what heaven has forbidden the ottoman?	0
no, very pale.	0
what i have done that might deeply hurt your nature ,  honor ,  and complaints ,  i here proclaim was craziness .	0
why ,  who’s so stupid that he can’t see through this fraud ?	0
send for the man ,  and ask him .	0
would i were in an alehouse in london !	0
sinful macduff ,  they were all struck for you !	0
where is my page ?	0
for thy three thousand ducats here is six.	0
do ,  good friend .	0
soft !	0
if they see you ,  they will murder you .	0
and i love hastings with all my heart .	0
this doesn’t look very much like portia !	0
spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation .	0
she has, and in that decision, is wasting her looks and charms; for beauty, starved with this woman’s severity, cuts beauty off from all posterity.	0
whether they meant to bathe in fresh, bleeding wounds, or create another crucifixion scene, i cannot tell.	0
she desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.	0
dearly ,  my delicate ariel .	0
never contradict him .	0
i must eat my dinner.	0
go .	0
god be wi' you .	0
tis but a little way that i can bring you ,  for i attend here .	0
i know our country disposition well .	0
god be with all of you ,  princes .	0
either we go after pompey or he’ll come after us .	0
good morrow ,  lieutenant bardolph .	0
but tell us ,  did you hear anything about antonio’s loss at sea ?	0
they’re ready whenever you are .	0
come ,  stir ,  stir ,  stir !	0
welcome ,  gentlemen !	0
what news?	0
the sin of my ingratitude even now was heavy on me.	0
i’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone i love ,  sharing the rest of her with others .	0
what ,  is the fellow mad ?	0

excuse me ?	0
county claudio ,  when mean you to go to church ?	0
when the butt is out ,  we will drink water .	0
did you fall ?	0
he may not, as lower persons do, select for himself, for on his choice depends the safety and health of this whole state, and therefore must his choice be subject to the voice and consent of that state that he is the head of.	0
farewell content!	0
and you just stand by too ,  and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure !	0
and i do think she’s thirty .	0
for love to appear in his true likeness ,  he would have to be as cupid is: naked and blind .	0
even if we fail at that ,  we can still fight him on land .	0
who shall prevent you from it?	0
i am but hurt .	0
such love must needs be treason in my breast .	0
i prithee ,  let thy wife attend on her ,  and bring them after in the best advantage .	0
mother ,  good night .	0
that he felt for me the love that i begged him to feel for you .	0
still so cruel ?	0
macbeth !	0
soul of rome !	0
i assure you ,  my man is as true as steel .	0
what is a man ,  if his chief good and market of his time be but to sleep and feed ?	0
no ,  uncle ,  i won’t be married .	0
my lord ,  i will use them according to their desert .	0
here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.	0
only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .	0
durst thou have look'd upon him being awake, and hast thou kill'd him sleeping?	0
wherein went he ?	0
are you ready ,  sir ?	0
indeed, i should have ask'd you that before.	0
believe me, i would rather have lost my purse full of money, and, except that my noble moor is true of mind and made of no such lowness as jealous creatures are, it would be enough to put him to ill thinking.	0
arm yourself .	0
he and lepidus are at caesar's house.	0
there’s no composition in this news that gives them credit .	0
where is the fellow ?	0
i remember ,  adam ,  that’s  here comes my master ,  your brother .	0
in cash ,  most justly paid .	0
now this joke has turned serious .	0
i’ll teach you how to flow .	0
my wife!	0
i swear ,  somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .	0
vent my folly !	0

my lord?	0
give me one kiss ,  and i’ll go down .	0
where is the beauteous majesty of denmark?	0
good - bye .	0
and therefore is winged cupid painted blind .	0
tie him up ,  i tell you .	0
what, the fair ophelia?	0
trebonius when to act ,  because ,  look ,  brutus ,  he’s taking mark antony out of the way .	0
thou wilt write to antony ?	0
look when i vow ,  i weep; and vows so born ,  in their nativity all truth appears .	0
my heart to her but as guest - wise so journ'd ,  and now to helen is it home return'd ,  there to remain .	0
do not talk to me ,  emilia .	0
it is my arm .	0
enjoy thy plainness .	0
i’ll set her on .	0
yes ,  every one of them ,  and every man here respects you ,  and every one wishes you had that opinion of yourself which every noble roman has for you .	0
a south-west wind blow on you, and blister you all over!	0
is't not enough, is't not enough, young man, that i did never, no, nor never can, deserve a sweet look from demetrius' eye, but you must flout my insufficiency?	0
what a miracle !	0
he’s married to octavia .	0
has cassius lived to be only mirth and laughter to his brutus, when sadness and ill-tempered blood aggravates him?	0
i mean ,  in a sort .	0
i must be one of these same dumb wise men, because gratiano never lets me speak.	0
i’ll limp after you .	0
what conquest brings he home?	0
to be brief—as the occasion requires—prepare to fight early in the morning ,  when your future will be decided .	0
i’ll tell them where you come from ,  though i don’t know who you are or what you want .	0
who knows not that the gentle duke is dead ?	0
her mood must be pitied.	0
they are .	0
i pray you ,  is my master yet returned ?	0
i have sent to seek him, and to find the body.	0
fair sister ,  will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?	0
whiles i see lives, the gashes do better upon them.	0
my mistress ,  sir ,  ”  quoth i .	0
or does he walk ?	0
my name's macbeth .	0
is it lost?	0
you’ll  “ never trust his word after .  ”  come ,  ’tis a foolish saying .	0
and since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is ,  fashion it thus: that what he is ,  augmented ,  would run to these and these extremities .	0
listen ,  sad friends ,  though the gods may rebuke me ,  this news would make kings cry .	0
sebastian are you ?	0
poor prattler ,  how thou talk’st !	0
come, come with me, and we will be quick, because, by your permission, you shall not stay alone until holy church incorporates the two of you into one.	0
madam ,  i am here .	0
a little bit of grief shows a lot of love .	0

excellent good.	0
let us hurry to hear it, and call the noblest to hear it too.	0
where the devil should this romeo be?	0
why ,  what’s the matter ?	0
he’s gone ,  and his wife’s dead .	0
indeed ,  upon my sword ,  indeed .	0
we have here written to norway ,  uncle of young fortinbras ,  who ,  impotent and bed - rid ,  knows nothing of his nephew's intentions ,  to stop his further progress in this plan because the levies ,  the lists ,  and full proportions are all made without his knowledge ,  and we are sending you ,  good cornelius ,  and you ,  voltimand ,  to take this greeting to old norway ,  without giving you any further personal power to do business with the king ,  more than the scope of these detailed items allow .	0
can you bring me to the party ?	0
when duncan is asleep— whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey soundly invite him—his two chamberlains will i with wine and wassail so convince ,  that memory ,  the warder of the brain ,  shall be a fume and the receipt of reason a limbec only .	0
from tripolis, from mexico, and england, from lisbon, barbary, and india?	0
o night ,  which ever art when day is not !	0
you greet my noble partner with current grace and great predictions of having nobility and of the hope to be king ,  that he seems carried away as well .	0
o villain !	0
oh ,  i suffered along with all the men i watched suffer !	0
why, then my shoe is well-flowered.	0
i don’t like that .	0
liberty !	0
how comes this trick upon him ?	0
heavens keep him from these beasts !	0
speak, i charge you.	0
o ,  by whom ?	0
i mean i will live on whatever i get ,  like birds do .	0
a noble ship of venice hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance on most part of their fleet .	0
by heaven ,  i saw my handkerchief in ‘s hand .	0
what would the king of naples do if he heard you say that ?	0
look here ,  “  he said ,   “ did you fall on your face ?	0
this wretch has part confessed his villainy .	0
nurse— ah sir !	0
yes ,  if that would be all right with your lordship .	0
look ,  he meditates .	0
cleopatra hath nodded him to her .	0
sir, his refinement suffers no lie from you, although, i know, to divide him like an inventor would make the memory dizzy with arithmetic, and yet not off course, in regard to his quick sail.	0
yes ,  that’s the one .	0
so i do still, by these pickers and stealers!	0
it is even so .	0
thy master is a wise and valiant roman; i never thought him worse.	0
it can only mean that you have murdered him; a murderer should look like you ,  so dead ,  so grim .	0
is he all right ?	0
what’s the news?	0
this is a nasty night to go swimming .	0
now ,  cinna; now ,  metellus; what ,  trebonius ,  i have an hour's talk in store for you; remember that you call on me today; be near me ,  that i may remember you .	0
goodbye ,  my lord .	0
is ’t lost ?	0
but tell me why didn’t you take action against these things ,  so full of crime and punishable by death ,  as you mainly were upset by concern for your safety ,  wisdom ,  if nothing else .	0
let me go with him .	0
he was wrong to do that .	0
the drink ,  the drink !	0
donalbain .	0
why are you asking me that ?	0
oh ,  eastern star !	0
my master's a very jew.	0
i do not like the office .	0
he heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not; the ape is dead, and i must conjure him.	0
one of you ,  stand sentinel over there .	0
infect her beauty ,  you fen - sucked fogs drawn by the powerful sun ,  to fall and blister !	0
in ,  or we are spoiled .	0
let the earth hide thee!	0
do all men kill the things they do not love ?	0
she has deceived her father ,  and may thee .	0
it sounds no more ,  and sure ,  it waits upon some god o' th' island .	0
i was never a thief or a pirate ,  though i admit i was your enemy for good reasons .	0
he's fat ,  and out of breath .	0
do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	0
we'll burn the house of brutus.	0
you take that.	0
since i have your good leave to go away ,  i will make haste: but ,  till i come again ,  no bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay ,  nor rest be interposer 'twixt us twain .	0
how say you, cassio?	0
where should she be ?	0
take it thankfully .	0
still ,  i’d hate to see my former dreams return .	0
tybalt ,  you rat - catcher ,  will you walk away ?	0
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast !	0
some comfort, nurse.	0
we won’t ,  sir .	0
what news abroad ?	0
it has leaked out that you’re hiding here .	0
go and tell them so .	0
ay ,  madam ,  from the reach of these my hands .	0
though now this grainèd face of mine be hid in sap - consuming winter’s drizzled snow ,  and all the conduits of my blood froze up ,  yet hath my night of life some memory ,  my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left ,  my dull deaf ears a little use to hear .	0
the same thing .	0
how are you, my lord?	0
fie ,  fie !	0
me, poor man, my library was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable; confederates— so dry he was for sway—with the king of naples to give him annual tribute, do him homage, subject his coronet to his crown, and bend the dukedom, yet unbowed alas, poor milan!— to most ignoble stooping.	0
he was so sharp when he was in school .	0
take him to the surgeons .	0
fie ,  what a slug is hastings that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no !	0
hail!	0
their battles are at hand .	0
this you should pity rather than despise.	0
was my father a traitor ,  mother ?	0
that’s really news !	0
lord!	0
if we be not relieved within this hour ,  we must return to th’ court of guard .	0
shall we sound him?	0
i think his soul’s in hell ,  my lady .	0
here is the money .	0
o ,  i have bought the mansion of a love ,  but not possess'd it; and though i am sold ,  not yet enjoy'd .	0
no one except her maid and a holy hermit .	0
where’s monsieur cobweb ?	0
this is what calpurnia’s dream means .	0
go fetch them hither .	0
nay ,  an you be a cursing hypocrite once ,  you must be looked to .	0
a rebel !	0
and how does your content tender your own good fortune ?	0
a pox o'that!	0
he has ,  my lord .	0
don’t be afraid although you see me armed ,  here is my journey's end ,  here is my bottom and very sea - mark of my last ship .	0
indeed, the top of admiration; worth what's dearest to the world!	0
why ,  are we turning to men ?	0
you can play no part but pyramus; for pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a proper man that you shall see on a summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must absolutely play pyramus.	0
who is here so low thatthey would rather be a slave?	0
what mistress do you have ?	0
that she was unfaithful in marriage ?	0

here, peter quince.	0
by our lady ,  thirty years .	0
what’s that ,  my lord ?	0
i do beseech you ,  take it not amiss; i cannot ,  nor i will not ,  yield to you .	0
men must not walk too late.	0
who maintains 'em?	0
alas ,  grim death ,  how vile and ugly your near - twin ,  sleep ,  is !	0
the eye of man has not heard ,  the ear of man has not seen; man's hand is not able to taste ,  his tongue to conceive ,  or his heart to report ,  what my dream was .	0
ay ,  honest .	0
you have said ,  sir .	0
yes ,  by heaven !	0
don’t you know he has ?	0
i’ve got something for you .	0
bless your heart .	0
well ,  i’m going to break in .	0
if he do ,  sure he cannot weep ’t back again .	0
good rest in the meantime!	0
this same skull, sir, was yorick's skull, the king's jester.	0
come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story . —good old man ,  you are as welcome here as your master is .	0
my duty ,  madam ,  and most humble service .	0
nor for yours neither.	0
yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; prerogatived are they less than the base; 'tis destiny unshunnable, like death: even then this forked plague is fated to us when we do quicken.	0
bow, stubborn knees, and, heart, with strings of steel, be soft as the muscles of the newborn baby!	0
what says my lord ?	0
donalbain .	0
octavia weeps to part from rome .	0
o, he's a lovely gentleman!	0
very well !	0
with this in mind ,  speak ,  my lord .	0
answer me directly.	0
your mind is tossing on the ocean, where your ships, with full sails — like gentlemen and rich citizens on the water, or as if they were in a procession of the sea— look over the minor merchants, that bow to them, pay them respect, as they fly by them with their woven wings.	0
not ever heard, or ever suspected.	0
tyranny is dead !	0
enobarbus ,  antony hath after thee sent all thy treasure ,  with his bounty overplus .	0
if you meet horatio and marcellus, the ones who will watch with me, tell them to hurry up.	0

i’ll read it . —it looks so unlike portia !	0
cousin hamlet ,  you know the wager ?	0
we want answers .	0

well ,  i will undertake it .	0
what were i best to say ?	0
there is no better one on earth .	0
where should othello go ?	0
why, but you are now well enough.	0
the little dogs and all ,  tray ,  blanch ,  and sweetheart—see ,  they bark at me .	0
it is a massy wheel ,  fix'd on the summit of the highest mount ,  to whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things are mortised and adjoin'd; which ,  when it falls ,  each small annexment ,  petty consequence ,  attends the boisterous ruin .	0
and since you know you cannot see yourself so well as by reflection ,  i ,  your glass ,  will modestly discover to yourself that of yourself which you yet know not of .	0
nay, stay and hear me speak.	0
despair thy charm, and let the angel whom thou still hast served tell thee, macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd.	0
what's here?	0
the reasons for a second marriage are low respects of saving money, but not for love.	0
now ,  as you are a roman ,  tell me true .	0
i’m done for in this world ,  i believe .	0
is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief?	0
wholeheartedly ,  good young man .	0
i will not live to hear the news from england .	0
her name ,  that was as fresh as dian's visage ,  is now begrimed and black as mine own face .	0
o woe!	0
aside] praise in departing.	0
hurry: you know where i’ll wait for you.	0
why, “as by lot, god knows,” and then, you know,”it came to pass, as most like it was.” the first line of the holy song will show you more, for look where my means of whiling away the time comes.	0
hey ,  hey !	0
waking] why, how now?	0
you’re too stubborn and too strange to your friend that loves you .	0
i’ve already slept ,  my lord .	0
let me not burst in ignorance ,  but tell why thy canonized bones ,  hearsed in death ,  have burst their cerements; why the sepulcher ,	0
wert thou not my brother ,  i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so .	0
with her, on her, whatever you want to think.	0
do what you will ,  dishonor shall be humor .	0
therefore speak .	0
i thank you, even for that: so, please, lead me to the chests so i may try my luck.	0
i should venture purgatory for't.	0
richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?	0
you mean the man who used to be othello ?	0
margaret ,  run into the sitting room .	0
talk you of killing ?	0
i thought it was all for the best.	0
he shall get his mind back there ,  or ,  if he doesn’t ,  it's no great problem there .	0
at supper?	0
not the one ,  i hope ,  that you got from me .	0
hello ,  sir !	0
control this anger!	0
so shut up !	0
i partly feel thee .	0
tears exhibit my voice.	0
i haven’t done anything wrong .	0
now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .	0
i am afeard ,  being in night ,  all this is but a dream ,  too flattering sweet to be substantial .	0

i shall be constrained in ’t to call thee knave ,  knight .	0
first ,  marcus brutus ,  will i shake with you; next ,  caius cassius ,  do i take your hand; now ,  decius brutus ,  yours; now yours ,  metellus; yours ,  cinna; and ,  my valiant casca ,  yours; though last ,  not least in love ,  yours ,  good trebonius .	0

for all ,  our thanks .	0
no ,  by no means .	0
o, i could play the woman with mine eyes, and braggart with my tongue!	0
we'll keep no great ado— a friend or two; for hark you, tybalt being slain so late, it may be thought we held him carelessly, being our kinsman, if we revel much.	0
i will confess it to all the world .	0
thy case, dear friend, shall be my precedent: as thou got'st milan, i'll come by naples.	0
say not so .	0
i beg your grace to pardon me.	0
you press me far, and therefore i will yield.	0

charmian !	0
juliet, the county stays.	0
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face ?	0
i saw a thousand shipwrecks ,  a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone ,  huge anchors ,  chunks of gold ,  heaps of pearls ,  and precious jewels—all scattered on the bottom of the sea .	0
are you sure of that ?	0
if we’d fought like this before ,  we’d have driven them home with bandaged heads .	0

what, mistress!	0
you’ll grant me ,  you hedgehog ?	0
if you tickle us ,  don’t we laugh ?	0
what’s the news with you ?	0
if you are so fickle, what do you want with a guy who is known for his faith?	0

we’re waiting here for you .	0
up .	0
our preparation stands in expectation of them .	0
i will not think it .	0
do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person’s face ?	0
i have night's cloak to hide me from their sight; and ,  if you love me ,  let them find me here .	0

what is the tyrant macbeth doing ?	0
what could i say ,  my dear ?	0
he’s so flighty in his old age ,  as we keep noticing .	0
revenge .	0
command this man to leave .	0
this is the sergeant who ,  like a good and hardy soldier ,  fought against my being taken prisoner .	0
will you dine with me tomorrow?	0
you have forgot the will i told you of.	0
then i well perceive you are not nigh.	0
live a little ,  comfort a little ,  cheer thyself a little .	0
what ,  jealous oberon !	0
th’ exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	0
stay ,  give me drink .	0
then heaven have mercy on me!	0
call her forth to me.	0
i have no opinion about him .	0
so is the dearest o' th' loss .	0
you can have a whole story ,  not just a word .	0
the moon ?	0
o heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever the soul of nero enter this firm bosom.	0
but this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood .	0
either you are really mistaken, or you commit these errors willfully.	0
ay ,  there’s the villany .	0
he’s welcome too .	0
if thou hadst feared to break an oath by him ,  th' imperial metal circling now thy head had graced the tender temples of my child ,  and both the princes had been breathing here ,  which now ,  two tender bedfellows for dust ,  thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms .	0
speak ,  hands ,  for me !	0
i will chop her into messes .	0
no ,  since .	0
hey, roderigo!	0
bring me no more reports; let them fly all !	0
a lover is more condoling .	0
go on .	0
stop !	0
here comes another group to see for you .	0
then let the trumpets sound the tucket sonance and the note to mount ,  for our approach shall so much dare the field that england shall couch down in fear and yield .	0
how?	0
it fits ,  when such a villain is a guest .	0
by my head, here come the capulets.	0
alas ,  iago ,  my lord has accused her of being a prostitute ,  thrown such angry and horrible words at her ,  as true hearts cannot bear .	0
no ,  by mine honour ,  madam ,  by my soul ,  no woman had it ,  but a civil doctor ,  which did refuse three thousand ducats of me and begg'd the ring; the which i did deny him ,  and suffer'd him to go displeas'd away; even he that had uphold the very life of my dear friend .	0
take him away .	0
come on ,  then .	0
and ,  moreover ,  god saw him when he was hid in the garden .	0
my master is the great and rich capulet ,  and if you don’t belong to the house of montague ,  please come and drink a cup of wine .	0
oh ,  these deliberate fools !	0
ah, good father, you see the heavens, troubled with man's acting, threaten his bloody stage.	0
what great luck the thick lips have ,  if he can get away with this !	0
as i have life and honor ,  there shall he sit till noon .	0
i’ll send tomorrow.	0
as i am a gentleman ,  i will live to be thankful to thee for ’t .	0
what proof is there ?	0
my bounty is as boundless as the sea ,  my love as deep .	0
drinks.	0
has romeo been killed ,  and is tybalt dead too ?	0
go on .	0
i do believe it ,  and i ask your pardon .	0
to england will i steal ,  and there i’ll steal .	0
the king and the prince are praying .	0
nay ,  i prithee ,  put on this gown and this beard .	0
music !	0
never come such division ’tween our souls .	0
what's the newest grief ?	0
by heaven, i don’t, i don’t, gentlemen.	0
there's such divinity doth hedge a king that treason can but peep to what it would, acts little of his will.	0
she’ll have to have it .	0
go to .	0
he’s at the duke’s morning and night ,  accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice .	0
so i’ll stay here for a while .	0
yet do i fear thy nature; it is too full o’ the milk of human kindness to catch the nearest way.	0
drown yourself !	0
then you live about her waist ,  or in the middle of her favours ?	0
go ,  coward that you are .	0
forgive me my foul murder?	0
did heaven look on, and would not take their part?	0
tell me ,  why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?	0
do you go back dismay'd?	0
ah, the immortal passado!	0
i’ll be bitter toward him ,  and curt .	0
everything about this is unnatural !	0
why ,  your lieutenant ,  cassio .	0
her name ,  that was as fresh as dian’s visage ,  is now begrimed and black as mine own face .	0
i’m not insane ,  sir topas .	0
didn’t he, right away, in pious rage, kill the two delinquents that were the slaves of drink and in the thralls of sleep?	0
many of antonio's creditors came with me to venice, swearing he can only go broke.	0
think on your sins .	0
i married them; and their secret wedding day was tybalt's doomsday ,  whose untimely death banished the new - made bridegroom from this city ,  for whom juliet pined ,  and not for tybalt .	0
go to, go to!	0
the thing is definitely going to be sold .	0
we have willing dames enough; there cannot be that vulture in you ,  to devour so many as will to greatness dedicate themselves ,  finding it so inclined .	0
hear everyone’s opinion ,  but reserve your judgment .	0
why, then, i think cassio's an honest man.	0
watch it, control your tongue.	0
now ,  sir ,  where is claudio ?	0
high and mighty ,  you shall know i am set naked on your kingdom .	0
every month he has a new best friend .	0
no ,  i’ll not weep .	0
to hear this ,  desdemona would seriously listen ,  but still the house affairs would draw her away ,  which she would finish in a great hurry ,  and she’d come again ,  and eat up my stories with a greedy ear ,  which i observing ,  once i took a rare hour; and found good ways to draw a prayer of earnest enthusiasm from her so that i would lengthen all my stories ,  which she had already heard bits and pieces of ,  but not all of them .	0
o ,  she was evil !	0
aren’t the others waiting for me ,  cinna ?	0
we three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .	0
my belongings are on the ship already .	0
o calm dishonourable ,  vile submission !	0
in such a night did pretty jessica ,  like a little shrew ,  slander her love ,  and he forgave it her .	0
he cried out ,   “ wait for me ,  dear cousin .	0
i’ll answer that .	0
why, how now, general!	0
that’s good advice .	0
tell me ,  and dally not: where is the money ?	0
i am not gamesome; i do lack some part of that quick spirit that is in antony.	0
young son, it is arguably a distempered head that bids good morning so soon to your bed.	0
i’m feeling very low ,  and i need to sleep .	0
but ,  my good lord— wherefore should you do this ?	0
i was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island .	0
we cannot be here and there too .	0
and then she brought me up ,  and i thank her for that ,  too .	0
what ,  aren’t you answered yet ?	0
you come to me and you say ,   “ shylock ,  we would have moneys .  ”  you say so ! — you ,  that did void your rheum upon my beard and foot me as you spurn a stranger cur over your threshold !	0
you won’t play then?	0
my soul and not my child !	0
a joint stool .	0
yes ,  you have to tell us why ,  sir andrew .	0
come, one for me.	0
are you sure of that?	0
the doors are broken .	0
patience ,  good sir .	0
both by myself and many other friends; but he, his own affections’ counsellor, is to himself—i will not say how true— but to himself so secret and so close, so far from sounding and discovery, as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun.	0
who's there?	0
take it to heart ,  dorset .	0
a sculptor or a painter couldn’t have screwed him up as bad as that ,  even as an apprentice .	0
ay .	0
three thousand dollars; it’s a good round sum.	0
i have it, and soundly too.	0
weeping and wailing over tybalt’s corse .	0
i know not .	0
a plague o’ both your houses !	0
goodbye .	0
out o'th’ moon ,  i do assure thee: i was the man i'th’ moon when time was .	0
but now behold ,  in the quick forge and workinghouse of thought ,  how london doth pour out her citizens .	0
they stumble that run fast.	0
i’ve promised to make everything right .	0
and lovers' absent hours being more tedious than the clock one hundred sixty times?	0
what ?	0
here, or at the capitol.	0
my brother’s servants were then my fellows .	0
three thousand ducats .	0
o heavens!	0
confusion’s cure lives not in these confusions .	0
but first ,  i’ll dump this fellow in his grave ,  then return to my love weeping with grief .	0
dost thou lie so low ?	0
will you go see the order of the course?	0
was that my father that went away so fast?	0
it is the nature of the climate .	0
no more of drowning ,  do you hear ?	0
servant - monster ?	0
consider how it stands upon my credit .	0
crystal is muddy.	0
get you therefore hence ,  poor miserable wretches ,  to your death ,  the taste whereof god of his mercy give you patience to endure ,  and true repentance of all your dear offences . —bear them hence .	0
o romeo ,  romeo ,  brave mercutio is dead !	0
nay ,  but ophelia— pray you ,  mark .	0
may he bless you ,  too .	0
hie you ,  messala ,  and i will seek for pindarus the while .	0
well ,  i’ve begun my reign with a carefully thought - out plan ,  and i have every hope of succeeding .	0
send your man away .	0
i’m sure his majesty will recover his health soon .	0
and isn’t a sheep’s grease as wholesome as a man’s sweat ?	0
ring the alarms bell.	0
o, what other favor can i do for you than to end the youth of your enemy with the same hand that cut your youth half?	0
i beg you ,  horatio ,  tell me one thing .	0
get away from me ,  you ass !	0
it is no mean happiness ,  therefore ,  to be seated in the mean .	0
will it not be received, when we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two of his own chamber, and used their very daggers, that they have done't?	0
i am content ,  so thou wilt have it so .	0
you have been talked about since your travel so much, for a quality where, they say, you really shine.	0
good night.	0
make it so known .	0
yes ,  he did .	0
how came she by that light?	0
what wouldst thou do ,  old man ?	0
if knowing what to do were as easy as knowing what was good to do, chapels would have been churches, and poor men's cottages would have been princes' palaces.	0
go to the church .	0
in bed asleep, while they do dream about things are true.	0
but tell me ,  is young george stanley living ?	0
the dearest ring in venice will i give you ,  and find it out by proclamation .	0
then i must be thy lady; but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land, and in the shape of corin sat all day, playing on pipes of corn, and versing love to amorous phillida.	0
actually ,  an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak ,  and he was brought up in the city .	0
pinion him like a thief ,  bring him before us .	0
will you ,  i pray ,  demand that demidevil why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body ?	0
if you want to come have dinner with me ,  you can .	0
yes ,  sir ,  they’re ready .	0
well, march we on, to give obedience where ’tis truly owed.	0
on the ground  sleep sound .	0
goodly lord ,  what a wit - snapper are you !	0
give me ,  ”       quoth i .	0
ah, good father, thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man's act, threaten his bloody stage.	0
he, being remiss, most generous and free from all contriving, will not peruse the foils; so that with ease, or with a little shuffling, you may choose a sword unbated, and in a pass of practice, requite him for your father.	0
am i your servant ?	0
the victim that smiles steals something from the thief; he robs himself that spends a unprofitable grief .	0
right in the middle of the fight ,  just when the battle could have gone either way—actually we had a slight advantage—that immoral egyptian nag—may she die of leprosy ! —suddenly became frightened ,  and turned her ships around and fled .	0
lady !	0
and what have kings that privates have not too ,  save ceremony ,  save general ceremony ?	0
be thou assur'd ,  if words be made of breath ,  and breath of life ,  i have no life to breathe what thou hast said to me .	0
mercutio’s kinsman ,  noble county paris .	0
why did you bring these daggers from the room?	0
is thy master coming ?	0
master constable ,  you’re going about this all wrong .	0
you didn’t offend us ,  you offended the king .	0
i dare draw as soon as another man if i see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .	0
i' th' clout ,  i' th' clout .	0
o grim - look'd night !	0
where is polonius ?	0
thou wast born of woman .	0
time ,  thou anticipatest my dread exploits .	0
look ,  and thou shalt see .	0
this is a love token from some other slut ,  and you want me to copy its pattern for you ?	0
from me he got it .	0
poor man!	0
you should pity rather than despise this situation .	0
tomorrow  , at your earliest ,  let me speak with you .	0
get me some poison ,  iago; this night .	0
or did i dream it ?	0
all right !  ”  it’s not fine ,  and i’m not all right !	0
what a head have i !	0
o all you host of heaven!	0
emilia ,  run you to the citadel ,  and tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd !	0
hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there ,  that kills and pains not ?	0
he has no children.	0
now go to the door and stay there until i call for you .	0
alas ,  how shall this bloody deed be explained ?	0
tell him, so please him come unto this place, he shall be satisfied and, by my honor, depart untouch'd.	0
next thing you know ,  he’ll be saying  “ widower aeneas .  ”   “ widow dido ,  ”  did you say ?	0
but if you didn’t know about it ,  then you were wrong to get mad at us .	0
i pray you ,  pardon me .	0
an old gray hare, and an old gray hare, is very good meat in lent; but a hare that is gray is too much to be billed when it ages before it used up.	0
is he gone and hath nothing ?	0
wow ,  he’s a real devil .	0
how sweet the moonlight sleeps on this bank!	0
i mean, the matter that you read, my lord.	0
my husband?	0
some true love turned false must follow because of your mistake, and not a false love turned true.	0
if thou didst ever thy dear father love— o god!	0
what’s the news ?	0
stop crying .	0
i think not of them .	0
there’s always a breath of fresh air here .	0
and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal !	0
nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.	0
happily met, my lady and my wife!	0
if he did that ,  it would be a charitable deed to hang him .	0
o you stupid moor !	0
reluctantly ,  i agreed–alas !	0
all the spirits hate him as much as i do .	0
where got'st thou that goose look?	0
he is a craven and a villain else ,  an ’t please your majesty ,  in my conscience .	0
good morrow ,  masters .	0
o ,  teach me how you look ,  and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius' heart !	0
caesar did write for him to come to rome .	0
come on ,  you’re drunk .	0
our wars are over.	0
it’s two o'clock now .	0
but stay ,  o spite !	0
there’s plenty of time .	0
o clitus !	0
good night ,  good night .	0
how say you now ?	0
that you shall surely find him, lead to the sagittary the raised search, and there will i be with him.	0
and here’s a marvelous convenient place for our rehearsal .	0
why ,  at her father’s .	0
for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty ,  which here appeareth due upon the bond .	0
oh god ,  remember to hear her prayer for them ,  just as for us !	0
don’t you know me, father?	0
hail !	0
if luck deserts us today ,  it’s because we defy it .	0
i won’t refuse you anything .	0
and ,  demetrius ,  the more you beat me ,  i will fawn on you .	0
be buried quickly with her ,  and so will i .	0
caesar ,  ’tis strucken eight .	0
i think our garments are now as fresh as they were when we first put them in africa, at the wedding of the king's fair daughter, claribel, to the king of tunis.	0
it were a tedious difficulty, i think, to bring them to that prospect.	0
have you no modesty ,  no maiden shame ,  no touch of bashfulness ?	0
i know who you are .	0
let me go ,  gentlemen .	0
tis a fair young man ,  and well attended .	0
i beg your pardon .	0
what is between you?	0
let's withdraw ,  my lord .	0
thy asses are gone about 'em .	0
i must confess your offer is the best ,  and ,  let your father make her the assurance ,  she is your own; else ,  you must pardon me .	0
come ,  vaughan .	0
shall they see us ?	0
therefore the winds ,  piping to us in vain ,  as in revenge ,  have sucked up from the sea contagious fogs ,  which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents .	0
if he struggles ,  use force !	0
here comes the lady .	0
go on; i'll follow thee .	0
why are you virtuous ?	0
but wilt thou hear me how i did proceed ?	0
o, once tell true; tell true, even for my sake!	0
o wretched fool ,  that lives to make your honesty a vice !	0
these recent eclipses of the sun and moon don’t bode well for us .	0
tell her i am arrested in the street ,  and that shall bail me .	0
o heavy burden!	0
wouldn’t it make one weep ?	0
such bugs and goblins in my life ,  that on the supervise ,  no leisure bated ,  no ,  not to stay the grinding of the axe ,  my head should be struck off .	0
and whatsoever else shall hap tonight ,  give it an understanding ,  but no tongue .	0
legged like a man and his fins like arms !	0
who’s that ?	0
after my death ,  the one half of my lands ,  and ,  in possession ,  twenty thousand crowns .	0
what a blunt fellow is this grown to be!	0
this grave shall have a living monument.	0
i pray you ,  rise .	0
nothing ?	0
yes ,  i am the one .	0
and we will hear it .	0
back ,  foolish tears ,  back to your native spring .	0
what news can you tell me of my lord?	0
i know her by her gait .	0
i think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is .	0
name one .	0
i don’t like your faults .	0
maybe it’s an english tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people’s clothes .	0
i pray you ,  then ,  in love and dear alliance ,  let that one article rank with the rest ,  and thereupon give me your daughter .	0
see ,  they encounter thee with their hearts’ thanks .	0
she provoked me with her lying mouth ,  accusing me of crimes i didn’t commit .	0
the enemy, marching along with them, will increase their numbers with them, and attack refreshed, reinforced, and encouraged; we shall cut him off from that advantage, if we face him at philippi, with these people behind us.	0
you might have rhymed.	0
the sum of all i can ,  i have disclosed .	0
yes ,  sir .	0
he shall spurn fate ,  scorn death ,  and bear his hopes above wisdom ,  grace ,  and fear .	0
no, take my life and everything, don’t pardon that: you take my house when you take the prop that holds my house up; you take my life when you take the means by which i live.	0
tybalt, do you lie there in your bloody sheet?	0
i had forgot thee.	0
i don’t know ,  and he won’t tell me .	0
i do repent me that i put it to you .	0
i an itching palm?	0
that our garments ,  being ,  as they were ,  drenched in the ocean ,  have ,  nevertheless ,  retained their freshness and sheen ,  seeming to be just cleaned rather than stained with salt water .	0
speak but one rhyme ,  and i am satisfied; cry but  “ ah me !  ”  pronounce but  “ love ”  and  “ dove; ”  speak one fair word to my godmother venus ,  one nickname for her almost blind son and heir ,  young auburn cupid ,  he that shot the arrow so well when king cophetua loved the beggar - maid !	0
i am sorry that with better heed and judgment i had not quoted him.	0
be merciful ,  say  “ death ,  ”  for exile hath more terror in his look ,  much more than death .	0
i will not disclose 'em .	0
sheathe your dagger.	0
oh ,  gods ,  give me patience !	0
the town is besieged ,  and the trumpet calls us to the gap ,  and we talk and do nothing ,  by christ .	0
how's the day ?	0
what do you say ?	0
your betters have endured me say my mind ,  and if you cannot ,  best you stop your ears .	0
a hundred marks ,  my kate does put her down .	0
will you play upon this pipe?	0
oh ,  my !	0
i didn’t do anything wrong that i know of ,  unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me .	0
please let me be your servant so i can be with you .	0
most noble brother ,  you have done me wrong .	0
our general cast us thus early for the love of his desdemona—who let us not therefore blame .	0
you may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock’s feather .	0
please ,  rosalind ,  my sweet cousin—be happy .	0
i didn’t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .	0
yes, i will; and i'll be wise hereafter, and seek for grace.	0
carry them away .	0
so do all thoughts .	0
oh ,  and young men never die ?	0
come on ,  close the curtain ,  nerissa .	0
by mary ,  farewell !	0
i’ll leave you now .	0
to do this is within the scope of man's wit, and therefore, i will attempt to do it.	0
what unusual reason brings her here ?	0
the people fear me in the country and the town .	0
aren’t these woods less perilous than the court ,  with all its jealousies and intrigues ?	0
what wouldst thou beg, laertes, that shall not be my offer, not thy asking?	0
it is here, hamlet.	0
a right fair mark, fair coz, is the first hit.	0
who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life ,  unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death ,  the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns ,  which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don’t ?	0
he’ll be a good governor .	0
and thither will i straight to visit him.	0
i’d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids !	0
where is the king ?	0
i am glad of it ,  for now i shall have reason to show the love and duty that i bear you with franker spirit .	0
come hither ,  gentlemen ,  and lay your hands again upon my sword .	0
in a town of war, yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear, to manage private and domestic quarrel, in night, and on the court and guard of safety!	0
good lord ,  you do me wrong— good lord ,  you do— to court me in such disdainful manner .	0
patience, good sir.	0
a metaphor .	0
ay ,  truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness .	0
and must they all be hanged that swear and lie ?	0
i have thee not ,  and yet i see thee still .	0
and, noble signior, if virtue no delighted beauty lack, your son-in-law is far more fair than black.	0
fast and pray to stave off temptations .	0
alas ,  my liege ,  my wife is dead to - night !	0
why, lamb!	0
do not weep ,  do not weep .	0
are we all met ?	0
i guarantee you ,  my man is as true as steel .	0
no more o’ that, my lord, no more o’ that.	0
my lord is dead .	0
you rotten scoundrel !	0
this is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you’re afraid .	0
come ,  come ,  come ,  come ,  give me your hand .	0
a double blessing is a double grace ,  it’s a better occasion to smile at saying goodbye again .	0
why do you keep to yourself, making the worst imaginings your companions, thinking those thoughts which should indeed have died with the dead ones you’re thinking about?	0
mistress ,  you know about that .	0
thy mother was a piece of virtue and she said thou wast my daughter .	0
but who comes here ?	0
don’t worry ,  sir .	0
it’ll help us more than hurt us .	0
knock at the gate ?	0
stop there, stop there.	0
let me think .	0
two deep enemies ,  foes to my rest ,  and my sweet sleep’s disturbers ,  are they that i would have thee deal upon .	0
madam, it just so happened that certain players we passed on the way here.	0
that would be scann'd.	0
he has killed me ,  mother .	0
why do you cry?	0
i don’t know how to play it ,  my lord .	0
i have ,  my lord .	0
i appreciate your frankness and your brevity .	0
go to him ,  sir topas .	0
but here's my husband; and as much duty as my mother showed to you, preferring you before her father, so much i dispute that i may profess due to the moor, my lord.	0
go in with me .	0
all is confirmed, my lord, which was reported.	0
as they pass by, grab casca by the sleeve; and he’ll, in his sour way, tell you what notable events have happened today.	0
o, if you were the noblest of your strain, young man, you could not die more honorably.	0
how can that be ,  unless she drowned herself in her own defense ?	0
doth thy other mouth call me?	0
is that how the law sees it ?	0
nay ,  come again ,  good kate .	0
therefore be double damned ,  swear thou art honest !	0
wherefore rise you now?	0
get your apparel together; good strings to your beards ,  new ribbons to your pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look o'er his part; for the short and the long is ,  our play is preferred .	0
know i these men that come along with you ?	0
keep promise, love.	0
how many times shall caesar bleed in sport ,  that now on pompey’s basis lies along no worthier than the dust !	0
good night ,  good night !	0
then cursed she hastings .	0
i kiss his dirty shoe ,  and from the bottom of my heart i love the lovely boy .	0
but now i see our lances are but straws ,  our strength as weak ,  our weakness past compare ,  that seeming to be most which we indeed least are .	0
was this before the king returned ?	0
are your doors lock'd ?	0
tis here!	0
why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade that he will keep out water a great while, and your water is a sore decayer of your wretched dead body.	0
i'll fetch them, sir.	0
am i to be dictated to ,  like a child ?	0
couldn’t you take some opportunity without my giving you one ?	0
come to the capitol.	0
shut up ,  fool !	0
your name ,  sir ,  truly .	0
we’ll along ourselves ,  and meet them at philippi .	0
i will go lose myself ,  wandering up and down throughout the city .	0
hath romeo slain himself ?	0
peter quince— what do you say, bully bottom?	0
happy is hermia ,  wheresoe'er she lies ,  for she hath blessèd and attractive eyes .	0
you have not half that power to do me harm as i have to be hurt.	0
saw you the king today ,  my lord of derby ?	0
but wherefore could not i pronounce “amen”?	0
just remember who you’ve got on board with you ,  good man .	0
alright ,  i will .	0
canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell ?	0
cousins, i hope the days are near at hand that chambers will be safe.	0
i am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace ,  that they seek authority ,  supremacy ,  and power when they are under an obligation to serve ,  love ,  and obey .	0
with nothing but truth .	0
no, that's true; that's very true.	0
ay, ay, three thousand ducats.	0
why, how is it now, stephano!	0
i would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing termagant .	0
revenge.	0
give me your hands all over, one by one.	0
what cannot be preserved when fortune takes it, patience makes a mockery of her injury.	0
o wicked wall, through whom i see no bliss, curs'd he thy stones for thus deceiving me!	0
that he hath used thee .	0
follow it ,  follow it !	0
it is to be all made of fantasy ,  all made of passion and all made of wishes ,  all adoration ,  duty ,  and observance ,  all humbleness ,  all patience and impatience ,  all purity ,  all trial ,  all observance ,  and so am i for phoebe .	0
i’ll send tomorrow .	0
my husband!	0
this is a rotten song to sing at a man’s funeral .	0
dost thou know me ,  fellow ?	0
for if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog ,  being a good kissing carrion—have you a daughter ?	0
it is offended .	0
i do agnize a natural and prompt alacrity i find in hardness; and do undertake these present wars against the ottomites .	0
where dwell you ,  pretty youth ?	0
but ,  adieu !	0
shall caesar send a lie ?	0
where is demetrius?	0
farewell.	0
i’m a gentleman ,  sir ,  and my name is conrade .	0
i’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me .	0
her father loves you ,  demetrius .	0
tell him ,  when that our princely father york blessed his three sons with his victorious arm ,  he little thought of this divided friendship .	0
i will die and leave him all .	0
all right ,  then .	0
what are doing away from home ?	0
where are you going?	0
i could not find him at the elephant .	0
am i the motive of these tears ,  my lord ?	0
god and his angels guard your sacred throne and make you long become it .	0
not i ,  my lord ,  by heaven .	0
forty thousand brothers couldn’t, even with all their quantity of love, make up my sum.	0
now, it’s the very witching time of night, when churchyards awake, and hell itself breathes out disease to this world.	0
go get some sleep; go where you are staying .	0
i even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .	0
i’m going to sell all my land .	0
o, find him!	0
i don’t love hermia; i love helena .	0
o calm ,  dishonourable ,  vile submission !	0
here's such a choice !	0
i hear that you must marry this count on thursday ,  and that nothing can delay it .	0
no, cousin, i'm going to fife.	0
calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep ,   “ help ,  someone !	0
i am too good to be in love with someone so low!	0
thou dost speak masterly .	0
no ,  i warrant you; i will not adventure my discre -  tion so weakly .	0
so fulvia told me .	0
it were an honest action to say so to the moor .	0
their defeat grew by their own actions .	0
and i won’t draw from my own weak merits the smallest fear or doubt of her turning against me ,  because she had eyes and chose me .	0
but since ,  you from the polack wars ,  and you from england ,  are here arrived ,  and so jump on this bloody question ,  give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view ,  and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about .	0
if you dare fight today, come to the field; if not, when you have stomachs.	0
will it please you to see the epilogue ,  or to hear an italian country dance between two of our company ?	0
his courage is hidden ,  and when it is revealed ,  it will shrink .	0
give me some ink and paper .	0
romeo.	0
i am sorry for you; you are here to answer a rock-like opponent, an inhuman wretch, incapable of pity, void and empty of any ounce of mercy.	0
a dream itself is but a shadow .	0
i’ll go and coach them .	0
no more .	0
god be with you!	0
sister ,  let’s eat and stop worrying .	0
have you killed tybalt ?	0
madam ,  i heard her speak .	0
though now we must appear bloody and cruel ,  as ,  by our hands and this our present act ,  you see we do ,  yet see you but our hands and this the bleeding business they have done .	0
what a head have i!	0

what’s the wager ?	0

o brave monster!	0
one .	0
there's not a nobler man in rome than antony.	0
that pure congealed white ,  high taurus' snow ,  fann'd with the eastern wind ,  turns to a crow when thou hold'st up thy hand .	0
but, o vain boast!	0
would you take it away?	0
and though i make this marriage for my peace ,  i’ th’ east my pleasure lies .	0
by mary, my child, early next thursday morning, the gallant, young, and noble gentleman, the count paris, at st. peter's church, shall happily make you there a joyful bride.	0
then one of you will warp and pull away—and there goes your marriage .	0
are you sincere ?	0
what would you have ,  desdemona ?	0
don’t ask to see this letter .	0
a little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .	0
where's satisfaction ?	0
a heavy summons lies like lead upon me, and yet i would not sleep.	0
here comes my lady .	0
first go with me to church ,  and call me wife ,  and then away to venice to your friend; for never shall you lie by portia's side with an unquiet soul .	0
what things are these ,  my lord antonio ?	0
tis a villain, sir, i do not love to look on.	0
his freedom is full of threats to everyone, to you yourself, to us, to every one.	0
between who ?	0
o you othello, that was once so good, fallen in the plan of a damned slave, what shall be said to you?	0
o, be gone!	0
soldiers ,  watch carefully .	0
what revels are in store ?	0
a thing of no importance .	0
the rabble call him lord; and ,  as the world were now but to begin ,  antiquity forgot ,  custom not known— the ratifiers and props of every word— they cry 'choose we !	0
thieves !	0
even so ,  lucilius .	0
my spirit has been as proud as each of yours ,  my courage as great ,  and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown .	0
no ,  he just smiles .	0
sir ,  my king ,  don’t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is .	0
i dare avouch it ,  sir .	0
here’s a spirit .	0
for ,  by this heaven ,  now at our sorrows pale ,  say what thou canst ,  i’ll go along with thee .	0
we must both give and take ,  my loving lord .	0
this may end without anyone getting killed .	0
what ladybird!	0
but, o vain boast!	0
is it fitting that ,  with the world divided into three parts ,  he should be one of the three to share it ?	0
dido and her aeneas shall want troops ,  and all the haunt be ours . —come ,  eros ,  eros !	0
tis a notorious villain.	0
i’ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose ,  just to see how brave they are .	0
wicked deeds will rise to be seen even if they are buried very deep in the earth.	0
don’t joke about his predictions .	0
why did cassius conspire against caesar ?	0
honestly, then i’m afraid you are dammed both by father and mother; when i keep away from the sea monster, your father, i fall into an equal evil, your mother; well, you are gone both ways.	0
and you won’t tell me who you are ?	0
well ,  then ,  there !	0
i’ve been invited to supper ,  jessica .	0
does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?	0
look you, she lov'd her kinsman tybalt dearly, and so did i.	0
in brief ,  sorrow would be a rarity most beloved if all could so become it .	0
what, good lord, boy!	0
nor stony tower ,  nor walls of beaten brass ,  nor airless dungeon ,  nor strong links of iron can be retentive to the strength of spirit .	0
not much .	0
do as thou wilt ,  for i have done with thee .	0
we won’t hold back any of our wisdom .	0
therefore, fair hermia, think about what you’re doing, think about how young you are, examine your choices well, whether, if you don’t take your father's choice, you can endure life in a convent, to be shut up in a cloister, to live a childless nun all your life, chanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.	0
this sword but shown to caesar ,  with this tidings ,  shall enter me with him .	0
i think they do .	0
you shall read us the will ,  caesar’s will .	0
do you have the flower ?	0
mercutio ,  you hang out with romeo ,  hang out !	0
what friend?	0
we pray you throw to earth this unprevailing woe ,  and think of us as of a father; for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne ,  and with no less nobility of love than that which dearest father bears his son do i impart toward you .	0
sir ,  his definement suffers no perdition in you ,  though i know to divide him inventorially would dizzy th' arithmetic of memory ,  and yet but yaw neither ,  in respect of his quick sail .	0
if i desecrate with my most unworthy hand this holy shrine of your hand, the gentle end is this, my lips, like two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.	0
wherefore ?	0
were you not sent for ?	0
but shall ’t be shortly ?	0
you’ll fall backward when you grow up ,  won’t you ,  jule ?  ”  and she stopped crying and said ,   “ yes .  ”  now you stop too ,  nurse ,  please .	0
speed him hence .	0
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .	0
you or any man living may be drunk at some time, man.	0
i’ll humbly signify what in his name ,  that magical word of war ,  we have effected: how with his banners and his well - paid ranks the ne’er - yet - beaten horse of parthia we have jaded out o’ th’ field .	0
he were an excellent man that were made just in the midway between him and benedick .	0
it is a fault that springeth from your eye .	0
filthy hags!	0
o, for two special reasons, which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, but yet to me they are strong.	0
ay .	0
are there no stones in heaven to serve as thunder ?	0
tis late .	0
is he not jealous?	0
here lies the county slain; and juliet bleeding ,  warm ,  and newly dead ,  who here hath lain this two days buried .	0
am i part of you but ,  as it were ,  in sort or limitation , — to keep you company at meals ,  sleep in your bed ,  and talk to you sometimes ?	0
please be quiet .	0
the law that threatened you with death becomes your friend and turns it into exile.	0
who treated you badly ?	0
what ,  brutus ?	0
it may well be called jove’s tree when it drops forth such fruit .	0
caesar !	0
i think she will be rul'd in all respects by me; nay more, i doubt it not.	0
whither are they vanished ?	0
in addition to the fact that we have wanted to see you for a long time, the reason we need to see you made us send our hasty invitation.	0
i meant plain holy thistle .	0
let their heads be slickly combed ,  their blue coats brushed ,  and their garters of an indifferent knit .	0
no one should have an honor he doesn’t deserve .	0
high'st queen of state, great juno, comes; i know her by her gait.	0
he ,  when he hears of her ,  cannot refrain from the excess of laughter .	0
we took him for a coward ,  but he’s the very devil incardinate .	0
very true .	0
where has he gone?	0
tis almost morning .	0
if i should speak ,  she would mock me into air .	0
and i will spend our time apart on my knees ,  praying for you .	0
i will assume desert:—give me a key for this, and instantly unlock my fortunes here.	0
let him alone; i won’t follow him any more with useless prayers .	0
and when she was here recently she flirted with edmund and gave him significant glances .	0
twas he informed against him ,  and quit the house on purpose that their punishment might have the freer course .	0
that cuckold lives in bliss who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; but o, what damned minutes tells he o'er who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!	0
iago ,  give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here ,  and ask him to pay my respects to the senate of venice .	0
tis exactly valued ,  not petty things admitted .	0
black night o'ershade thy day ,  and death thy life .	0
he is called ensign pistol .	0
they stand and would have parley .	0
ay ,  if a woman live to be a man .	0
say no more against it .	0
why are you silent ?	0
there has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .	0
romeo slew him; he slew mercutio .	0
it was addressed to him ,  and orders must be obeyed .	0
then where would you have me go ,  adam ?	0
there's wood enough within.	0
to work as a servant .	0
and you ,  fair sister .	0
tell ventidius i want to speak with him .	0
if they let you off ,  then we’ll have to assume that lady justice has lost all her power .	0
sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow; when i am absent, then lie with my wife.	0
i mean, the matter that you are reading, my lord.	0
